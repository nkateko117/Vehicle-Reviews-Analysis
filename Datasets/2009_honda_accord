<TEXT>After 18000 miles I had to have new back breaks put on. The leather is fading inside already - car is garage kept. Noise is really is ridiculous. Got 21k on it now and would trade it in if I could and get something else. Should have just saved my money and got the 4cylinder instead.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Accord for close to 2 years now and it runs beautifully and I am very happy with my purchase. But there are 2 things, I would like to bring to other buyers notice. First, when it had about 20,000 miles, there was a cranky noise when you start it cold. Took to dealer and they changed the alternator for free. The other issue was noise from rear brakes and I had to finally replace them, with my own money. Feel it was too early for brakes to wear out and make noises (I am not an adventurous driver).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 2009 as my 5th Honda accord, and couldn't be sorrier. My previous ones were excellent, so I didn't pay as much attention as I should have to this model. After 40 min. the seat is so uncomfortable, I have to get out and give myself a break. It feels like concrete inside it. The road noise on trips is unbelievable. I really miss my 2003 accord and regret trading up to this model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in love with the new design. It looks great and drives well. I purchased the 4-door EX-L model in a manual transmission. I did a large amount of research before purchasing this car and found that it was really the best car for the price. All of this to say, I am extremely disappointed in my vehicle purchase. Apparently I should have done some more research. The squealing brakes after less than 5000 kms are completely unacceptable. I would never recommend purchasing the 08/09 models to anyone. Honda has disappointed so many people by creating, marketing and selling such a product. Do not buy this vehicle until Honda decides to issue a recall & fix this problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in a good deal. This is my first Honda. The fuel economy is pretty good. I got over 31 miles in my first few trips (mixed driving in city roads and highways). This car has manual driver seat adjustments. It took a while to adjust the position of seat to get a comfortable posture. The ride is bumpier in bumpy roads. There is lots of road noise in cement roads. The 99 Camry that I owned previously had good suspension and less road noise. The sound quality of the music player is mediocre especially for mp3 songs. I liked the style and it is fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have 3 Honda's - although this one looks great - couple of things: road noise (so loud yesterday that I couldn't hear my son on cell) - I know that road surface plays into it, but... really. Brakes squeal, seats are ok - but being short it is hard for me to find the optimal position for steering wheel without it blocking out speedo. Also, passenger airbag light comes on intermittently and some engine lights too. Keep thinking about that Bimmer... will give this a few more months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Brakes squeak from day one, transmission makes shredding, tearing noises when putting in reverse and then drive, headrest forces your head forward, when full gas tank sounds like a swimming pool sloshing around and already had a safety recall for poor build quality with "noises" coming from the back of the car. Road noise is horrible on certain roads. You still want to risk buying this car?? My last Honda ever! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned Hondas for the past 12 years and this car is as nice as any I've had. Performance of the 4cyl. engine seems a bit weaker than my past 2 Accords but is by no means a dog. Complaints about the seats being uncomfortable don't factor into my opinion at all. I find them very comfortable especially for long trips across Texas. I find them a bit low for exit, but not a problem at all when I'm in the car. I drive in the El Paso area quite a bit and as far as fuel economy is concerned, I get almost 28 mpg on every tank of gas. This car is a keeper and I'll continue to buy Hondas in the future.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Both interior and exterior design are exceptional. This car says first class from bumper to bumper. Fuel Economy has been far better than expected. In 4 months of ownership I've averaged almost 28 MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a jaguar which I loved very much, but I also hated. The car drove me nuts being in & out of the shop. I went to Honda because my husband owns a Honda Si which he loves. I did not want a Honda, I was hesitant about going, but then again I needed something reliable. I test drove a few cars but was looking for something with speed. They gave me the V6 Accord to test drive. I liked it, it was nice, & had the speed I was looking for. I was hesitant about getting it but I needed a car that I could depend on. So I bought it & the more I drove it I loved it even more! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Of course I got the top of the line model you can get, I love how much room this car has, the bluetooth, the speed, the mpg. I drove to Vegas & back from San Jose one weekend. On the way back about 1/2 way I had 1/4 left in my tank, I filled up my tank & the gas lasted me all week from home to work.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was struck on my driver's side by a drunk driver going 50mph three weeks ago and I emerged without a scratch! This car is built like a tank (she was driving a Volvo). I LOVE this car and have thoroughly enjoyed it for the last 18 months. It's very eye-catching -- I catch people staring into it when it's parked and they're always shocked to learn it's an accord (I bought the red -- so pretty). Yes, I'm really this shallow... The ONLY thing I would suggest changing is the controls for the heat. It's hard for me to reach the heater control without having to lean way over. But, that's virtually the ONLY thing I would change.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 17 years, I am coming back to Honda. Had a 1983 Accord for 7 years and was superb. I think that the car is great, but road noise is very disturbing, considering the prestige and class of this car. Fuel economy is great, compared to the gas guzzler Kia Amanti V6 just traded in. Do not have the opportunity to hear the XM Radio, because the satellite signal can't reach Puerto Rico, but the outside antenna gives class to the car. At the beginning had problems with the seat, but got used to them.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>NO MORE HONDA</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I had my Accord for 13 months total, put over 20k miles on it. I could not stand the uncomfortable seats any longer. The headrests bothered me because they would push my head forward no matter which height they were at and the seats were rather hard and the lumbar support did not provide much satisfaction. Honda Customer Service told me that they cannot do anything for me at this time as the seats and headrest are designed to safety regulations and if they have a recall, they would let me know. Last week, I traded it in for a well equipped 2009 S80, which stickered for $42k and I bought it for $32k. The seats are much more comfortable and I no longer have back pain when driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great technology in the car, decent fuel economy (30+ mpg on long highway trips), never had any issues with anything else except the seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving a bunch of cars, including Acura TL, Lexus IS, C class Mercedes, Infiniti...it was an easy decision to settle on the Honda. Absolutely great value for the money, performance is superb, feels great, just like the Acura TL. Some reviews on this forum complain about road noise...I have not heard it at all. Also I read complaints about the seats...somewhat true but in my case I find it forces me to just sit up straight and have better posture. Overall, I love the car. My only wish is cosmetic: projector beam headlights and LED tail lights. I paid 27K and change for mine plus all the other dealer options, TT&L, etc etc. I do not regret my choice at all!</TEXT>

The only somewhat negative comment I have is that road noise is a little loud but nothing that's unbearable. The stereo is great, the Navigation system is awesome and it has a great ride.

<TEXT>I have had my Accord for almost 2 months now, with about 3500 miles on it. Overall, this is a well designed and well built vehicle. The V-6 is smooth and powerful when needed. The Accord is an excellent mating of power, comfort, handling and solid road feel. It does everything well for a family sedan. I really like the interior and while it suffers from too many buttons, the layout is intuitive. I am a bit disappointed by the poor sound insulation and the stereo is mediocre, the heated seats don't really work that well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 6th Honda that I've purchased new and so far this is my favorite car. I purchased the Accord EX to replace a lease return Acura RSX Type-S. The build quality is excellent and the mileage is exactly what was advertised. I was a little concerned about the seat comfort based on some of the reviews left on Edmunds.com. I can honestly say the seats are far more comfortable than any of my previous Honda's (2 Accords, 2 Civics and a CRX) and also more comfortable than my Acura RSX.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first car in 30 years for my wife as we have always had vans and suv's. The 4 cyl - 190 HP is very responsive and the first 337 miles we got 27.7 mpg with 65/35 hwy/local driving. No doubt that this car will get 30+ cruising at 65 on the hwy. The steering is very responsive and the leather seats are supportive and comfortable, no problems with the headrests. Lots of std features. Great deals now on the 2009's. Our dealer bought outright our 2007 Honda Pilot EXL with 13 months on the lease and we got the Accord with no money down and very low lease payments.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The drivers seat is very hard, and hurts the thighs. The Accord gets fair gas mileage. The carpet looks cheap I can see the lining of the carpet. The audio system sound is not very impressive. At 180 miles my brakes needed to by repaired, warped rotors. A lot of noise, road as well as rattles. My previous car was a 03 Honda Accord EX. Miss that car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>In an effort to simplify my life, I traded in my Lexus SUV for a 2009 Honda Accord EXL. Take that Chevron and Mobil! I loved the look and feel of the car. The woodgrain interior and upgraded stereo were luxurious options. It was a good fit for me. And, I was feeling pretty good about my decision - the first 39 minutes of my drive home. That?s when I noticed the tinge of pain surging from my neck down through my back. I was in excruciating pain!!! I looked back quickly and realized that the Active Headrestraints would be the bane of my existence. A good idea gone wrong.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a new Accord 9 months ago. Would not buy again. I have chronic back pain since driving the accord; didn't have problem with my Odyssey. (doesn't happen to my husband, but it kills me). Took a long time to figure out the cause. Within 15 minutes of sitting in the Accord, my back flares up. Doesn't matter if it's the driver side/passenger. Transmission stinks: doesn't shift at the right spots, will tach up to 5 getting on the highway. Feels like I have Fred Flintstone feet under the car. Wish I knew before buying it how disappointing it is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Considered 09' Acura TSX but it was smaller, more expensive, cost more in insurance and only had a few more luxury stuffs. Considered and test-drove '09 Mazda 6. The interior was almost as big but the materials used seem inferior; dashboard design not as elegant and the side mirrors were 1/3 smaller. 6's Bose stereo also didn't sound any better. After 3 months the Accord is exactly what I expected. I thought real hard about V6 but the 4-cylinder can handle everyday driving without much problem. Every now and then when hard acceleration is called, flash of regret of not buying V6 came across my mind but mostly this version does the job just fine. Bottom line: best family sedan today.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy exactly as advertised (24mpg mixed). Very pleasant and comfortable ride. Wife drives CR-V but always prefers to ride with me. Solid and stable even above 80mph.

<TEXT>Bought 09 Accord EX V6 (cloth) in April. It was a replacement of my 2004 V6 Toyota Camry after total. Accord is a bigger car, which I don't necessarily like, but I did not want another Camry and was unsure about Malibu due to the situation with GM. I like the performance and comfort of the car. No problem with seats. There is definitely much more noise than was in the Camry, some say this is because of tires, some say it is due to glass. MPG is average - seems like my previous Toyota was better. VCM is annoying with downshifting and slowing down. I do not know if it really improves MPG - I shift to neutral downhill and it runs faster. ECO light is annoying and distracts attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice car but the front RT brake started to squeal. Dealer reports no Honda fix to the issue yet. Still trying to get everything replaced until it is resolved. Also poor gas mileage, averaging 20 mpg in rural driving. Other than that it has been fun to drive so far. Do notice the VCM kicking in and out , could be smoother or perhaps a bypass to go into full time 4 or 6 cylinder mode.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were forced into purchasing another car. We were coming out of a 2000 Nissan Maxima SE which is billed as the "family sports car" and it is. We had all the bells and whistles and we loved that car. New Maxima was out of our price range. Previously had a Honda Accord back in 1986 which we loved, kept it until 212,000 miles so that's why we went back to a Honda. Did lots of research on this purchase and for the money it seemed like we should have been thrilled; we got $6K off the sticker and have had it 5 weeks and put 5200 miles on it. We are getting 36MPG which is fantastic BUT the driver's seat and steering wheel are horribly uncomfortable. Very tough getting used to this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The seats in my 2009 Accord are so incredibly uncomfortable that I can't continue to drive this vehicle. Even though I will lose money I will have to sell this vehicle. The Honda engineers really missed the mark in this regard. In the past I have owned a 1985 Accord, a 1990 Accord, a 1995 Civic, and a 1998 Accord the seats in these years and models were quite comfortable. Have been told by Honda of America that the Honda engineers decided to redesign the seats and I should have gone for a longer test drive. Needles to say this once faithful Honda customer will no longer be buying and driving Hondas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car to death. I drove an '88 pathfinder for 8 years and finally upgraded to this beautiful baby. I love everything about it. The ride is tight and smooth, the sound system is crisp, the seats are perfect (everyone else is crazy to say anything bad about them). The only complaint I have is that there is no fuel economy gauge so that I can tell how well I'm doing with the mileage but that is relatively minor. I would recommend this car to pretty much anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall this car has been solid and reliable for the most part. My biggest complaint is the driver's seat. I did not notice this until I took the car on 1+ hour trips, the headrest design causes the headrest always to be in contact with your head, adjusting the height and seatback does not seem to help. Also, the seat does feel very hard on my back. I notice that I have been making more trips to the chiropractor than before. I had high hopes for this car, but based on how I feel from longer drives and how it is affecting my overall health, I honestly cannot wait to get rid of it. Honda customer care said the seat is designed according to safety regulations and they will not help.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Accord is our eighth Honda. I am very happy about the safety and reliability of these cars. This car has improvements on the 2006 model such as regular tires which gives a much smoother ride. They have included fog lights at no extra charge. However, the seats are very hard compared to the '06. Very disappointing gas mileage 17-19 mpg avg. Much worse than the '06 V6. Considering the new VCM technology it should be much better. It should not cut off the cylinders so often, it should be after you are cruising for a few minutes on the highway. And, you can feel it going back and forth. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this in 9/08 and was in the shop constantly. My biggest concern was the oil usage, one qt every 1500 miles. Honda's official response after monitoring its consumption for 3 mo. was "as long as it didn't burn one qt every 1000 miles, it was normal". That's their official response, and that was not coming from the dealer, that was HONDA. Other concerns: one burned out cat converter, (daaa wonder why), 4 tires replaced due to vibration at hwy speeds, never did solve the vibration. 2nd gear syncros not messing without a grind and missed shift. (no it was not my shifting expertise, Honda) I was told by Honda that the oil burning would go away, maybe. Ya, right! I sold this gem 3 mo ago.</TEXT>

Great looking vehicle with most of the options I was looking for. Interior is classy. Have had the car three weeks, put on 2800 miles including one 1600 trip. Read the complaints about the firm seat. I had some concerns, but after the 1600 miles had no aches or pains, and I am not young. I think it is a great seat. I have been very pleased with the MPG. 27.7 MPG at 78 MPH. 23 MPG around town.

<TEXT>There is a lot to like and little to dislike about this car. Interior design, exterior design and build quality are excellent. The engine has adequate power, the dash layout is great - backlit instruments, user- friendly A/C and radio controls (no problem with the button stack layout) and plenty of bins and cup holders. The seats are a bit firm but not uncomfortable around town, still waiting to take a long trip. Road noise is higher than my previous Camry but not bad enough for a big complaint. Gas mileage so far is 22 city which should improve over time. Excellent handling. Got the car for invoice, including dealer add-ons, plus an additional $1000 discount.

<TEXT>My 2009 Accord EX-L V6 coupe. I recently purchased the above car in crystal black pearl, with a black interior. In terms of exterior styling I personally believe it is one of Honda's best looking cars to date with its flowing lines, chrome accents, large wheels, and, expressive curves. I find the interior to be very luxurious, visually appealing, and very well put together. The textures and materials of the interior, especially the leather trim and aluminum look accents are of high quality. The power from the 3.5 liter V6 is smooth and strong, complimented by a perfect balance of sporty handling and a comfortable ride, all while being reasonably quiet. I highly recommend this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a well appointed vehicle, given the price point. I hadn't planned to purchase a different car for about 2 years, and I didn't intend to purchase a new vehicle (had planned to buy a certified used Honda). But, given the feature set, the reliability, and the cost, I decided to take the plunge, and purchase a new one. I don't regret it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather trimmed interior, with heated seats. Yes, I know. The feature isn't normally available. The dealership had one (Yes, an LX-P) on the showroom floor, with leather interior and heated seats. It was already sold, so they "made" another one for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a Honda owner since 1979 and my 2009 coupe is the classiest to date. I really enjoy driving it. It handles and brakes extremely well, but it lacks power/acceleration when passing cars on the highway. I'm sure a 6 cyl would be more responsive. I am not intimidated by the center dash controls and at night the cockpit looks very impressive.The leather seats are very comfortable and the diver seat controls make it easy to adjust. I am very impressed by the separate climate control system for the driver and passenger and the 6 CD stereo. I'm a little disappointed in the trunk space. I can just squeeze in my large golf bag and cart. Overall there is no other car that I would want.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test-drove many cars, several of which were great (Prius, 2010 Ford Fusion, Camry) but as a confirmed Honda driver, I came back to the 2009 Accord. Love everything, but I have to agree with several other reviewers that the driver's seat is often downright uncomfortable -- I'm a 5'6" female and the seat back hits me in the wrong place, throwing me into a very unnatural position. Putting on the lumbar makes matters worse. I'm hoping the seat softens up and takes on the arm-chair cushiness of my 2006 Accord. Cup holders are still in bad position and dangerous because you have to look down at them to remove a beverage cup. But it's a beauty, decent mileage, drives well, plush, very roomy, mine!</TEXT>

<TEXT>While this sedan is probably one of the best around, make sure you test drive. The VCM at 65-75 MPH is constantly changing between the 3-4 modes and can cause jerking response. It is noticeable, causes nausea. Make sure you are ok with this. Be aware that the car must be warmed up for the VCM to work. Using cruise control and holding your right foot extremely still helps. Otherwise just drive 95+ to keep it in 6 mode. Everything else is just same good old Honda...engine...controls, fit/finish...reliability</TEXT>

<TEXT>Here is the breakdown: I've owned 6 Honda's (civic, preludes, accords). This car is more fun to drive than all those put together. I just traded in a '06 V6 Accord sedan 6 MT. Wanted something more sporty but dependable. Test drove a Lexus IS, Infiniti G37, and BMW 328i. All great in their own way. All at least 10K more than I paid for the Honda. Didn't make sense paying the extra change when the practical and fun choice was the Accord. Car has many extra features that are add-ons on the other cars. Car is black on black and it turns heads. Wasn't a big fan of the sedan design (little too big), but love the coupe. Before you buy any coupe in the 25-30K range, test drive this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think most people have always confused the accord and the civic with some kinds of wannabe track car. These are passenger vehicles. Front wheel drive and fuel efficient. Everyone wants these tight handling sedans. Honda would not survive if they did not grow. In this country we have wide open streets and long straight highways. Yes; we will have the occasional twisty. Think of this car as a step up from the 07 accord. Similar to the 2000 Acura RL. It is a safe reliable family and passenger vehicle. If you want performance, you want rear wheel drive. Get an S2000. It's a great car with good firm wheel feel. Consistent steering and solid brakes. Roomy and comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2007 civic si 4 door sedan on a new accord. My wife could not drive the 6spd manual and she hated the ride. I must say I am a die hard Honda lover, my past 2 cars were civic's, one an ex manual coupe and most recently the si. The accord is way more family friendly and has better creature comforts but I miss the style and handling of the civic. This car seems enormous to me but maintains tight handling for such a big car. The exterior looks great and the engine seems to have enough pep for a 4 cylinder. I researched the Camry as well, and honestly I think this car is better handling and the interior is built with better quality. It's no civic si but it is still a Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Honda I have owned. For the past 6 years I have driven a BMW 3xi series with all wheel drive. I wanted to get a coupe without breaking the bank. I looked at the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. I decided on the Honda Accord V6 Coupe and am extremely satisfied. The car delivers on all aspects of driving a coupe? styling, handling, performance and fun. It drives great and has a nice interior. I like that it has V6 power when I need it and that the engine adjusts down to 4 or 3 cylinders when the V6 is not needed. It also runs on regular gas which is an added savings. Overall, it has delivered on all my expectations. </TEXT>

When I drive home it is nothing for me to get 30+ MPG. GREAT gas mileage on mine! There was a rattle in the sunroof, brakes squeal after a few months. Notified Honda, USA about it. Both suddenly stopped after a week. Backseat is very comfy, but driver seat can take its toll on me when driving home. VERY smooth ride, for those that care the exhaust is pretty good, leather is a good quality leather unlike Hyundai, the build quality is... wow amazing!

<TEXT>My second Accord. The reliability and resale value are unbeatable. The ride is firm, but it has a sporty feel to it. The seats are quite comfortable. I love the sound system that adjusts it's volume to the speed of the car. The center of the dash is very cluttered. Driven the car 5000+ miles and still have to take my eyes off the road just to tune the radio. Too many buttons. The MPG is a major disappointment. Bought the 4 cylinder hoping for the advertised 30 MPG. Not even close. 26 is the best I've ever achieved; after 2 straight hours of interstate driving. Usually 22-24, with a low of 21 MPG.

I got 14-16 mpg in city and 24-26 mpg since I bought this car. Even acura tl is better than this 2.4l accord as I got 20,26 mpg city/highway. The seats are very uncomfortable and I often feel back pain when I drive long. Bcos the car is too wide, the driver cannot rest left arm on the left arm rest of the door. Too much of road noise.

Super uncomfortable driver seat and when below 20 degrees outside, better bring extra clothes. No insulation at all. Handling does not come close to the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Very disappointing.

<TEXT>This is my 5th new Honda. I owned an Accord in 2003 and gave it up when my company offered me a company car in 2007. They gave me a Toyota Camry LE V6. The V6 Camry had loads of power. Got decent gas mileage as well. For some reason, I really missed my 2003 Accord LX (4 cylinder). The Honda was just put together better. I could tell the Camry was a mass production car. The floor carpeting came in several places, some of the plastic molding wasn't fit together very well, etc. Bought a new 2009 Accord EX-L (4 cylinder) to replace it. Fit and finish is superior like a remembered it and everything is laid out within easy reach and makes sense. Relatively noise free, ride is very stiff.</TEXT>

Road noise is higher than other sedans in this class but not horrible. I expect that when I eventually replace the OEM Dunlops that road noise and handling will both improve. Trunk is not huge but big enough. Appearance is of course very subjective but to me the car looks an awful lot like a 5 series BMW. Fit and finish is without equal in this class and for around 20K</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a Honda owner for 8 years and my wife and I have had 6 during that time. They've all been extremely reliable and safe cars but they've also been like vanilla ice cream when it comes to looking at them. They've all had the features we've wanted and most of them have been loaded. But until this new design, none of them have been very exciting. This car is gorgeous!! And it stands out getting looks everywhere I go. I opted for the coupe because I didn't like the look of the sedan, especially in the rear. The coupe however changes all of that! I went with every bell & whistle available and no regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 months of driving my Accord I can say, it is the best driving experience I've had so far with sedans. I worked for a car rental company and drove all kinds of cars so I have something to compare to. Many people prefer dial temperature and other controls but I can say that all buttons are very intuitive easy to operate and contribute to a superior and modern interior look. Handling is great, acceleration is excellent, haven't noticed dimming headlights. Lots of leg room. Have absolutely nothing to complain about. I love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do these companies get away with misleading mileage estimates? I have had my 4CYL Accord EX-L for almost a month and have yet to break the 22 m.p.g barrier on mixed or extended highway trips!! The acceleration for the 190 h.p is very good and the steering is nicely weighted. The ride though is very stiff and the leather driver's seat is even stiffer. I have a 37 mile one way drive to work and it is annoying trying to find a comfortable seating position. Honda please isolate the road noises luckily it has a good radio to try and drown out the LOUD road noise. I think higher profile tires might soften and quiet the ride...MAYBE!! I'll need the high resale value on the trade in SOON!!</TEXT>

Cylinder deactivation is flawless. There have been no maint. or repair issues at all. A perfect car! Very spacious vehicle for pax and cargo. Memo to Honda... integrate grab handles into the A-pillars, use a manumatic trans, a fuel mileage readout would be nice in this class of car,a sixth gear or lower ratio for fifth gear for better highway mileage,and memory seats would be nice. This is a great and almost perfect vehicle. Buy and enjoy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I LOVE my new car! I've put 5k miles on the Accord. Traction control prevents burning rubber, but whatever. What is fun is going from 40 to 80 in like 2 seconds. Don't worry about the "click" when shifting into DRIVE; they all do it. When snow gets in the wheels, they vibrate at > 50 mph. Windshield wash fluid only holds <1/2 gallon - and the pump is wussy. The driver's seat is not comfortable. I have some suggestions in the section below. Sound system rocks. Visibility is fantastic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car is just SO bad. I do believe it is the hottest car on the road. Weight/HP is about 13 whereas most <$23k cars are 20 so performance is great.

<TEXT>I waited till I had about 1,500 miles on my car before evaluating it, and I can say, it is still my favorite car that I've ever owned. I had a 1994 Integra before this, and this is worlds apart in comfort, ride, noise (lack of), and style. It doesn't corner like a 2700 pound integra, but it still handles better than most 3500 pound cars. I got a manual, and it's the smoothest one I've ever used. I was surprised to find that the gear ratios for the manual are similar to the automatic, so there's not much difference in performance. The only "fit and finish" problem I have is the trunk lid is little lower on one side. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After many years a Toyota owner I cut the cord and went with this top of the line Honda because of the new design and increase in rear space. Clients feel comfortable and many compliments on style of car. I hope after purchasing it for an extended period of time I learn to enjoy it more. Been very unhappy with brakes. Inside comfort has been less than desirable especially for longer drive periods and I feel less spacious than I thought when I test drove it. The side pockets, center console and under radio compartment (which is very hard to get to) provides for not much space. When carrying a cell phone on your hip, the seat belt snap is in a bad location. But little space left to store it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A sharp looking car that turns heads. To be a 4 cylinder, I like the pickup. I drive 180 miles a day to and from work which is all interstate, so keeping up with traffic is no problem. But.. the drivers seat is very uncomfortable, the radio cuts out when using a gps unit plugged into the power port, passenger seat when pushed up to let passenger into back seat does not return to its original setting, always has to be reset, road noise is bad, headlights dim down when compressor kicks in, gas cap will scratch side of car so be sure to put it in the cap rest in the gas door. I've always been a Pontiac man, and I sure do miss my Bonneville. This is the first and last Honda I will ever own.</TEXT>

This car is a keeper. I just love it. When I walk out to it and get in, I am so happy. The handling, the comfort, the radio controls on the steering wheel are superb.

<TEXT>After researching several competing models I settled on the Honda Coupe 4 cyl. automatic. It seemed to offer a reasonable compromise between fuel economy and sporty styling. The ride/drive was uninspiring until adding after market 18 inch wheels and 245/40/18" tires which made the car a much more enjoyable vehicle in most all respects, primarily due to the reduction in unsprung weight (check the weight of the factory wheel tire combo). I'm averaging 28 MPG overall, and with the acceptable performance of the 190 HP 4 cyl., I don't feel like I'm driving a "econobox".</TEXT>

Having owned a Camry in the past, we are extremely pleased with Accord's driving performance and how we 'feel the road.' Don't worry about the road noise or seat comfort (lack of). We also looked at Altima, Camry, and Prius, but we thought Accord had the best overall value. Go and test-drive for yourself.</TEXT>

This car gets so many looks and compliments--it's often mistaken for a BWW or Lexus! I'm so glad I chose the V6 model-the power is incredible..also the silver door handles give it a nice quality touch. The temperature and audio controls can be somewhat complicated at first, but I am starting to get used to them. Everything is explained in the manuals, so read up! The heated seats are a nice welcoming feel on a cold winter day. Great job Honda! What an improvement over the previous body style (yawn).</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is very pretty but don't let the looks fool you. I only have 800 miles on the car and so far it's been a bad experience. I never bought a Honda before and I am disappointed in every way. After hearing all the great reviews from everyone I had to try. The car rattles on medium radio volume (about talking level, I don't like loud music). No brand new car should rattle. The audio quality is horrible. Poor, not as expected gas mileage (16 mpg with mixed highway/city driving). The windows constantly fog up and rear defroster doesn't work. There's also a lot of road noise! I should have spent the extra money to get something else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched and drove multiple cars for months before deciding the V6 Navi was the best decision for the $. I wanted the coupe, but the back seat was a non-starter for adults. Awesome sound system! Mileage not what I expected from the VCM engine, and I drive with a light foot. Navi isn't intuitive yet, but I hope to be better with it after a couple months. The climate control system is exceptional. People I talk to through blue tooth say the sound quality is very good. Exceptionally fine handling and steering. After 4 Hondas and 3 Mercedes, I'm sold on Honda. Why pay twice as much for an unreliable Mercedes when you can have a car like this?</TEXT>

<TEXT>After months of looking found blk/blk 2009 accord coupe. Love it. I'm the type that researches and test drives lots of vehicles prior to purchase. This car fit my needs: comfortable, safe, stylish, affordable, and quality build. No car has everything otherwise we would all be driving "that" car. The EX is good value but I think the EX-L in the 4 cylinder might be the apex of the group in terms of performance/value/style. The V6 is fast and will appeal to the enthusiast, but in my mind it would only get me a speeding ticket. The 190HP 4 banger is good once you get it above 3500 rpm. Below that accel is nothing to rave about. Buy this car in the EX-L: V4 for value; V6 for kicks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After also considering the redesigned Mazda 6, I decided the Honda was the better choice. The design quality inside and out makes it seems like it is a BMW or Lexus, but at substantial savings. I've received so many compliments after only 1 month! The V6 engine has phenomenal power, but yet still gets decent gas mileage. The heated seats are very relaxing on a cold winter day. Temperature and audio controls are somewhat complex, but I'm getting used to it (Fan will all of a sudden start blowing at higher speed for some reason--not sure what's up with that.) Also VSA feature doesn't have a dashboard indicator saying whether it's on or off. Honda did a great job on this redesign!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After many test drives, Avalon, Camry, Altima Coupe, Jetta - I traded in my Maxima and purchased the Accord Coupe V6. My second Accord in 4 years and I must admit the styling is a knockout. The black on black is a beautiful combo. Handling, comfort, dash layout, ergonomics - top of the line. If you took off the badges I'm sure people would not know what it is - this isn't your folks Accord. Only complaint is the variable cylinder concept. When cruising the car feels like it is skipping, missing, sputtering. When you give it some gas the puppy jumps. I love it but would have preferred a manual. I do miss the Bose sound system in the Maxima. Overall a great car at a great price!!</TEXT>

I'm hooked on satellite radio now though so that's going to be an added expense for me. When I was looking for a new car, it came down to this or the Chevy Malibu.

<TEXT>Very good power, great gas mileage, and typical high quality Honda I've heard so much about. The only major downside to the car is the above average amount of road noise that you hear on the highway. Around town road noise is not an issue. This is our first Honda and will probably not be our last. This Accord is equal or better in some areas than our Lexus ES which we love and was almost $10k less. I now understand why Honda sells so many Accords. I find it far better than the Malibu, Fusion, Passat, and Altima all of which I've had for long-term rentals for business. I can't say enough about how great the dealer service is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Honda accord drives like a sports car, has great positive steering, not the mushy feeling like Nissan or Toyota. Love the exterior design, even Mercedes has copied it. I'm 6,2" and enjoy the leg room. The seats are great, reminds me of the 911-s I used to own. The interior also has the full size feeling (the Altima and Camry were definitely mid-size). Gas mileage is very satisfactory, getting about 23 1/2 mph town-33 mph hiway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 09 Accord is a quality auto. Honda has again kept its simplicity, superior quality, and affordability.

<TEXT>I upgraded from a 1999 V6 Accord. The bigger body style does not fit my frame. The window starts too high for you to rest your arm, there is little room for your fingers when you adjust the rear view mirror, console too far right, seat not all that comfortable, too long of a reach to the steering wheel (my shoulders get tired when driving long distances). The sporty feel of driving the car is gone. It handles great, performs great but the inside now feels like a grandpa car. I didn't test drive it enough to notice it at first. I miss the feel of the old car. Bummer. And, they limit how loud the stereo will go! That amazed me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I spent months researching cars before purchasing my Accord EX-L V6. If you want something reliable, sporty, stylish, fuel efficient and comfortable, you should definitely look at the Accord. For the money, and for somebody who doesn't require a bigger vehicle (no kids, etc.), this car is worth looking at. The top of the line trim comes at a great price for all of the features and the quality (and it looks better than the cheaper trims, too). Lastly, for a coupe, it's large enough that you're comfortable. I just ask anyone considering this car to test drive it. If it's for you, you'll know it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1) Beautiful styling. The car looks like an Acura, putting competitors like the Nissan Altima coupe to shame. 2) Performance. The V6 handles well in snow and rain, and is fast. 3) Comfort.

<TEXT>After agonizing over Avalon, Lincoln MKS, Camry, Taurus, Fusion, and starting my search determined to buy American, I arrived at the conclusion that this was the most car built by American workers on the market. The ride is just a step below the Acura TL, the gas economy for a v6 is wonderful, especially balanced against the power and acceleration the engine provides. The only bad thing I can say about the seats is that they are not quite as supportive as those in the Acura TL. Let me tell you, if you want the same equipment in a Taurus or an Avalon or Lincoln you will need another $7,000.00 so do yourself a favor and put the extra money in your pocket and seriously consider this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove 09 models of Nissan Altima, Mazda 6, Ford Fusion and Hyundai Sonata. Honda Accord is the best choice, no doubt. I concede that Nissan Altima and Mazda 6 are little more fun to drive with their sporty look and more torque with better acceleration. However, when you realize the difference in the comfort, handling and smoothness of the Honda Accord, there is no need of second guessing yourself. Also the backseat leg space is ample. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the safety features that come standard. Nice wheels, chrome headlights. Heated mirrors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a Honda fan since 80 (first Civic) and having gone through every model since, I was pumped to get rid of my 95 accord with 240K on it. My search of reviews indicated the 09 Accord coupe was a good buy. Then I bought it and reality set in. The car constantly hunts between cylinders and when not on cruise control and is the most irritating thing I have ever experienced. Perhaps it is the letdown from my emotional attachment to Hondas. While I like everything else about the car, the VCM constantly changing speed trumps all that - and therefore DO NOT BUY. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the way my Honda looks drives. The ride is firm, but gentle and the braking is superb! The radio in the Ex-L sounds great. I am still trying to get used to the headlight flicker that occurs at night. Not sure what is causing that, but it is not that big of an issue. The one big issue that I am experiencing has to do with the driver's seat. The seatback has a pronounced lumbar support that "forces" your back into an S. For me, this becomes painful after a few minutes of driving. So much so that I may have to trade it in for a different car if I can't get used to it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature, if you call it a feature, is the styling. I get lots of looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now that I have 3k miles on the car, I want to share my experience. I have a LX-S 4cyl model, in white. After the first month of ownership, I took the car for a weekend trip to central coast, CA (est. 600 miles). For a 4cyl, it has excellent acceleration (kinda reminded me of my 2002 Lexus IS, but not quite). It is very roomy and very stylist. The ride is a bit rougher than the Camry. The seats are a bit uncomfortable. Mechanic is good. Steering wheel does not vibrate like other 4cyl. Fuel to power ratio is excellent, maybe the best in its class. It would be much more fun to drive, if it had rear-wheel drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the 190 hp, 4 cyl. Fuel consumption was as much as a 165 hp car. Interior and trunk space were very roomy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at the Hyundai, and Altima but I went for the better quality Honda. Every three years my lease is up and I try hard to stray away but fortunately every 3 years I make the right choice. This Honda is bigger than the Altima, Camry, Hyundai and just about as big as the BMW 5 series sedan. There is just enough of what you need here, and still remains very competitive in price and quality. I am happy with the interior quality, I am happy with the drive, and this is overall a very classy reliable car so far!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I enjoy the aux port, std 17 inch wheels on all EX and above models, and the handling, but most of all this is one quiet interior wise vehicle. I think that while all the above is fun to talk about the STANDARD safety features are key.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my wife a 2009, Accord, EX-L, nav, with every option. We love the car. The car has Lexus and Infiniti styling at a fraction of the cost. More room than the M-series, and better mileage. This is our fourth Accord, and is our first leather Accord. The back seat room is incredibly large, and our sons are 6'2" and 6'4". Their legs don't touch the front seat. This is the best Accord that Honda has ever made. If I had the money, I would get two of them. Don't worry about the road noise. This car is pure quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a new 2009 Honda Accord in Omaha NE. Gave it to my daughter for her birthday and She took it to college in San Antonio. The seat will not lock in 2 o'clock position well and sometimes just drops back while driving; and the brakes squeal, all before 2,000 miles. She took to Gunn Honda in San Antonio and they said the brake noise was from vibration (duh) and wouldn't fix it. The seat wouldn't misbehave at that time. I don't blame the original dealer. Honda Customer Service was not helpful and tried to tell me the seat dropping back was a feature. My initial impression is that the car is of poor quality and that Honda will not fix it. All this in under 2,000 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As previous Honda van owners, I felt we couldn't go wrong with the Accord when I needed to upgrade my 12-year old car. Has good pick-up from start and when on the highway and can get up to triple digits if necessary. I've had no issues with it in the first 10 months of ownership, which is what I expected. Want more speed and features? Step up to the EX/V6. Want good, reliable, safe, basic transportation? Kind of hard to go wrong with the Accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car earlier this month and absolutely love it. I did a LOT of research on 2009 sedans (including Camry, Accord, Jetta, and Altima) before deciding on the Accord. The Accord is top-notch As soon as you get in it you feel like you are sitting in a luxury car that should be much more expensive than a Honda. And performance is great! I am very pleased with the car...except for 1 thing---the headlights dim just a bit about every 15-20 seconds when the AC is on. The only reason I noticed it was because I was looking for it (I had read about it in some of the reviews). However, this is not a big enough problem to keep me from loving my car!! Honda's reliability is excellent.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Too much plastic</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Drives and handles well. The TPMS (tire pressure monitoring system) light came on the second day I had the car and no matter how I tweak the tire pressure it won't go off (common problem). I assume this may have something to do with side airbags but the sun visors are poorly designed & are not long enough on both the right and left sides leaving gaps for sun glare. The center stereo console is too big & you need pretty long arms to reach the right side buttons comfortably. It's like they just made the buttons bigger and spaced them out to fill up space. The steering wheel has cheap plastic silver pieces in the center that I cannot believe they used. Plastic wheel covers are very cheap. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote a full review about this car here on Epinions under the name Bigtruckseries. The Coupe is VERY sexy, very sporty and for less than $34,000 loaded, it gives a great sense of having more without having paid more. The seats are comfortable if you are a short person but the tall won't like it as much. The V6 is the best model, with plenty of ZIP for city cruising while the 190 HP I4 doesn't disappoint those with no need to speed. Good steering Bad body roll Plasticky interior The major downside is a cluttered center stack, poor user interface in the Navigation system and terrible voice controls that can accidentally change the temperature before doing what they should.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system is a must have in my opinion if you plan to own this car more than 5 years. I'd also suggest the auto-start alarm system in the Sentry 2000 to keep people from stealing it. My girlfriend got her's free.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first and probably only Honda. This was a want vs. need purchase. Coolest style V6 coupe w/o nav at under $30k MSRP (paid $26950) is main reason I chose this model. Good pickup, quiet motor and interior. Love the standard ipod adapter but the subwoofer is substandard! The trunk lid needs alignment, one speaker was bad, the passenger front seat needed to be tightened and there are two very visible paint blemishes on the pillar above the driver mirror all which were noted for correction by the dealer at delivery. Having said that, I feel the final factory pre-ship inspection was poor and I hope for better days ahead having driven only 600 miles. 23.5 overall mpg so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the following: 1994 Accord LX Coupe; 2005 Toyota Camry LE; and now, 2009 Accord LX Sedan with 5-speed manual. My new car was bought after much detailed and painstaking research. Issues with past Accords that kept me away: Road noise, stiffness of ride, high price, arrogant dealerships. I got lucky by finding a good dealer that gave me good value on 05 Camry. Camrys started to have an issue with valves rattling (70K miles!), so I may have had a lemon. It was a refined vehicle, and the ride in my new Honda is a only a touch louder and harsher, . But I get better mileage, more agile, new suspension is wonderful. Close & tough choice, but made best decision. Looks more masculine !</TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally planned to buy the 2.4L EXL I4 5MT coupe, but after seeing and driving the V6 6MT, I had to have it. The extra 2 grand gets you better looking wheels, Homelink, fog lights, integrated spoiler, dual exhaust, and some other small odds n ends make it worth the cost (since I would have wanted to upgrade the wheels and put fogs on the I4). The V6 also provides a great amount of power, but the I4 will suffice for most and is sufficient. I only wish that the 6MT had a taller 6th gear. I get the EPA rated 26 mpg, but I'm sure it could be better with a taller final drive while still being fast on the low end. </TEXT>

Performance of the inline 4 cylinder 2.4 I-Vtec motor produces 190 hp transported through a smooth 5 speed automatic delivering more than enough power to commute around town. One downfall is the EPA rating 21 city 31 highway. We had always expected better than that from Honda.

<TEXT>I had higher expectations from this new 09 Accord however, I find it to be inferior to my 04 V6 Accord in both comfort and road noise. Road noise can be solved with different tires such as the Bridgestone Turanza Serenity tires that I have on my 04. They are extremely quiet! However front seat comfort is another story. There is too little cushioning and the side bolsters are too extreme! The driver's seat is a bit better because of the 8- way power adjustment which allows the seat cushion itself to be raised or lowered and angled flat if need be. The passenger seat with just a 4-way adjustment does not allow this. Honda needs to immediately fix this problem with an 8-way power passenger seat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very upset with Honda and how they are handling the complaints. I have had just about every issue discussed...brakes, tires, handle, lights, mileage and additionally the tube to the exhaust came off so my vehicle sounded like a race car for a bit! How embarrassing! The worst part about it is the issues are not one time they happen over and over again. The dealership said "there was no recall" and that they could only fix with what Honda sends them. So, I called Honda directly and they responded by saying "there is no recall on the vehicle". Unbelievable. I believe both dealership and Honda Corp. are in denial and don't want to spend the money or invest the time to make it right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall we purchased our Honda Accord because of past experience owning one. Too bad for us that we found out that there are some build quality issues that, while not life threatening, are annoying nonetheless on a new car. These include such things as squealing brakes, adhesive protruding out behind plastic panels, and loose rear view mirror. Our manual transmission also is not as smooth as we've been accustomed too. We will be taking it into the dealership to see if we can get any of these issues taken care of. Unfortunately for Honda this will be the last Honda that we will buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I reviewed this Honda back In April and here it is mid September. In addition to my post on 04/26/09 I'd have to add more bad news. In addition to the gripes I have with the car the list grows still larger. The seats are the worst seats in any car I've owned and I've once owned a Yugo when I was a lad so I know a bad seat when I feel one. Also the Brake discs are now warped and feel that "judder" one feels when you brake. I have had many cars but never one that had just 7,000 miles on it that felt this old so fast. The sunroof although has only been opened a few times sometimes takes 2-3 times to close. I went to try and trade it in they offered me 18-19K after only 5 months. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my accord. It's my third accord actually. But this one must was the black sheep of them all. I have a discolored rear pearl bumper that I have become accustomed to. Looks the worst when it rains since the car is pearl white. The bumper is more like a creamy color. But now the inside is bugging me, the arm rest looks like junk, the leather is bubbling up really, really bad. Soon it's going to all become lifted off. There's actually websites talking about this issue all around the web. Honda says it's not covered by warranty. They quote me a price, which is over 20% more expensive than I can get online. Why would they charge to fix this since it's obviously a quality issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not sure why there are a lot of complaints about this car. Mine has been an extremely pleasureful car to drive. For a great price, you get a car with the superior Honda quality and technology, great acceleration (had it up to 130 with power to spare), comfortable and in a very attractive package. I looked at BMW, Mercedes and Lexus. This Accord was whole lot less money and gave all the features yet again, with the Honda reliability and quality. I love the car and I'm very happy with the purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought Accord EXL-Navigation 5 months back. We added a few more features, including back up camera and the total cost was 28,0000 dollars. The interior is spacious and airy. The car is fun to drive. However, just within months we notice annoying vibrations with steering wheel, the door handle is tight and giving difficulty to open, the remote only functions near the car. Gas mileage is around 25mpg with mostly highway driving, that to I drive at 55-60mph. In comparison my 2003 Impala V6 cylinder was giving much better mileage than this 09 Accord, 4 cyl!! However, the most annoying fact is the road noise. I am disappointed with the value for money of this car and it is not better than GM car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2005 LX for the 2009 EX. First, resale value is sweet! Mine was a lease that I went about 20K miles over. I traded it in rather than returning it and after the lease payoff the dealer cut me a check! Overall, I love the new Accord. I disagree with a lot of people and find the seats very comfortable. For those that don't, READ the owners manual on proper adjustment of the head rest; there is a page on that and it makes a big difference. As for brake issues and MPG, both are great for me. If yours is not, try relaxing when you drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a 22 y.o. new grad with NO CREDIT HISTORY and Honda was the only dealer that financed me through one of their "new grad programs." I am happy with the car, gas mileage is LESS than what I expected from a Honda. Sad to say I got rear ended 2 weeks after I got it. I didn't feel too much impact even though the bumper got messed up bad from a four car collision, SO ITS A VERY SAFE, RELIABLE CAR. The body is much improvement from later models. This is the 3rd Accord Model our family has. BUT, I think if I only waited for a few months, I could have gotten the 2010 CAMARO instead. Oh well, I'll stick to this one... for now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Car has been pretty good so far. It's not bad for a 4 cylinder. The ride is ok. You can tell they cut corners from the previous generation model. It's bigger than I would have liked it to be but I did not like the styling of the civic, and I thought it was a little smaller than I wanted. Overall not a bad car, but not Honda's best in my opinion having experience with 3 Accords before. Also the braks wear out prematurely (my back brakes wore out after 17,700 miles) only owning the car for 10 months. Buyer beware the brakes have a design flaw noted in the currant issue of Motor trend. They got only 15,000 on a set of 4 brakes and were quite shocked when they took it into the dealer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Sadly, this is our last Accord for a while. We have had all the brake issues described before. Ours was fixed under warranty 5 times and now we are told we are on our own by Honda. The service bulletin everyone is waiting on is not coming. The '10's will be out next month, so 2 years and no fix is just that. No fix. The cycling of the exterior lights is just annoying. Its much worse than Hondas past that only did it when the compressor kicked in and was not that noticeable. And yes we were very disappointed in the seat comfort of the EXL model compared to years past. Traded it for a Venza at 45k, sadly we are done with Honda, the quality and customer service is just not there anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The drivers seat is very uncomfortable, and I didn't really notice this discomfort until after a 30 minute drive. The seat cushion on the bench part of the seat (the part of the seat the fanny sits on) is way too firm. And the front of the bench part of the seat does not tilt down enough to avoid excessive pressure on the underside of the thighs. I will have to have a wedge shaped custom cushion fabricated to solve this problem. I have sat in a 1999 Honda Accord, Nissan Altimas, Toyota Camrys and Mazda 626s, and they all have much more angle adjustment on the bottom seat cushion than the 2008 Accord. Honda needs to go back to the drawing board on their front seat design for the Accord!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Buying a 2009 Accord has been the worst purchase I've made in the last 20 years. Several days after bringing the car home, I started hearing a loud wind noise through the drivers side door when you drove at freeway speeds. After 5 trips to the dealership and having it be in the shop for 2 weeks, I was essentially told, I'd just have to deal with the noise. Wonderful! Then at 2000 miles the brakes have started to make a grinding noise, oh and I've noticed a vibrating sound coming from the dash (which I hit with my hand to stop), not to mention the loud clicking the CD player makes. Essentially this car is a mess, save yourself some money and go buy a Geo Metro.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took my New Accord V6 sedan on its first road trip. Seats were comfortable, unlike some reviews I have read, and the V6 delivered the pep that you won't find in a smaller engine. 300 mile round trip and temperature was in the mid 90's and it delivered 23.9 mpg with the air on and mountain driving. It has all the bells and whistles, Navi system that will take getting use to and XM radio which I have never had. Only complaint is an occasional sqeak when brakes are applied. Used the "cash for clunkers" deal so -$3500, Figured the car I traded a 1988 Jeep Pioneer with 168k was worth maybe $1000 so the rest was the sales tax. This is my first Honda and so far am very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive it to work mostly, and it turns heads, being very exotic and unique without many Accord Coupes on the road. I don't mind the seats at all, as I don't plan on falling asleep in my car. Very roomy interior, the control is no comparison to my old vehicle. Only downside is the vehicle is quite heavy in bulk, and it does take some power to go up hills. But that has always been an issue with fuel economic cars. Power vs. fuel consumption. The car just looks really nice, and its drivable for someone young and car loving like me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Vehicle drives like a $20k car. The road noise needs improvement. I drove a 97 Volvo 850 for the past 12 years and the Volvo was quieter than the Honda on the highway. I am not sure if different tires would do the trick or maybe a redesigned suspension. I also own a 08 GMC Sierra Crew Cab which has a smoother ride than the Accord; it may be because of the longer suspension but the truck has 20 inch wheel which means less tire to absorb bumps and it still rides better. I purchased the Honda because it gave the most bang for the buck for the size and comfort the vehicle offers. Overall the Honda is nice and stylish, all that needs to be worked on is the road noise and ride.</TEXT>

I have been to the dealer 4 times for buffing the rotors, replacing the rotors, replacing the front brake pads and each time after a few days the loud piercing squeal is back. Called American Honda Cust Service and they say that they are unaware of any problems. The dealer says there isn't a problem and that brakes do make a little noise. (I can hear it over my radio blasting, trying to drown it out!!!) This has been a horrible experience and I will not purchase from Honda again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I researched this car, complaints seem be centered around VCM, uncomfortable seats, road noise, and brake issues. 300 miles after I purchased this car, I am yet to experience issues in any of these areas. VCM seems to work fine; I've driven up and down hills and on straight roads, speeds up to 70 mph, and transitions are far less noticeable than gear changes. I do not consider road noise an issue as long as you don't compare it to a Lexus. I am yet to experience any issues with the brakes. Overall, seems to be a well built car, handles far better than my old Camry, and am reasonably satisfied with it.</TEXT>

The accord is typical Honda, stiffer ride more road noise, however the steering - handling and everyday driveability is excellent. For a 4 cyl 3200 lb automatic car the overall performance is fantastic. I have not gotten under 30 mpg on any tankful. The active noise cancellation and adjustable lumber support along with the 190 hp engine warrant paying for the Ex. This is not a perfect car, however for the price -drivability-room-handling- mpg-crash results-resale value and practicality its hard to find something better.</TEXT>

After the fifth visit, the dealership admitted that Honda knows about this problem; apparently Honda has a Tech Line stating FRONT BRAKE SQUEAL and PREMATURE REAR PAD WEAR on 2008-09 Accord and Accord V6. In addition, I have problems with different buttons squeaking & the only thing they have done is spray oil on them. I have contacted Honda for help, nevertheless, nothing has happened? they are claiming Honda ENGINEERS are working on the brake problem (almost 2 years) & they are not willing to make an attempt to fix it by replacing the pads.

<TEXT>I'll try to be as critical as I can to give a good opinion. The problems other posters have mentioned, are definitely there though. First, the uncomfortable seats. Yes, I see what everyone means. I did end up buying a $12 seat cushion from Walmart that has made a difference. Seats aren't the best for long drives. Second, the "ECO" function, with switching from 6 to 4 cylinders is a little annoying as well. You have to learn how to optimize the accelerator pedal to minimize this. Navigation not as good as Lexus RX350, but I'm still learning it. Voice recognition not all that. Otherwise, I like the car, the look. It's not a sports car, but I'm pretty happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The seats (EX-L coupe) are simply awful for both me and my passenger. I get back pain, and my passenger gets neck pain from the head restraint. None of this was apparent on the test drive. Takes about 45 mins. or an hour to kick in. I have never had this experience in over 35 years of car ownership! Also don't like rear visibility. Can't see objects in rear quarter, and hard to tell where the rear bumper is in parking. Finally, low end torque with 190 Hp is still sub-par. On paper (and test drive) this is a fine car. Have owned two other Honda's with no problems. Unfortunately I let that sway my purchase. Am considering trading in for something else, with only 1100 miles.</TEXT>

Coming from a 03 Infiniti G35, I actually like the firm ride and road feel which offers strong cornering and good tracking. I paid $23,300.00 for EX-L version with the 4 cylinder and I'm extremely happy with the purchase. The interior is very roomy and offers good comfort. The Accord has a unique design that offers a sporty Eurpoean look. I decided to go with the 4 cylinder as I'm tired making too many trips to the pump and paying the expensive price of premium fuel.

There was no major decision in my purchase; all of the research I'd done came up with the same two answers: Honda or Toyota. I drove a Civic and was appalled. I drove an Accord and was astonished. It handled like a dream. The I-4 motor was powerful, smooth and quiet. The 5- speed gearbox was a joy. Looks, compared with the Camry...no contest. The dark grey metallic paint...Oooh baby!

Driver side leather seat is very uncomfortable after 10-15 minutes of driving. Gas mileage is worse than advertised (I average 23 mpg). Honda America has no resolution to date for any of these problems. Additionally, my passenger side door was dinged a month ago and paint has already begun to chip. All in all, I deeply regret having bought this car and am continually disappointed with Honda America's problem-solving capabilities or lack thereof.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car looks great from the outside and several strangers have commented on its great road-side appeal. Interior space is very roomy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The front seats are simply the most uncomfortable I've ever experienced. The lumbar plates that are part of the 'active head restraints' are the primary culprit but even with them removed the seats are still awful. I'm seriously considering trading this in after 5 months and 4,000 miles. Beyond this, it's a fairly solid car. But the fuel economy is disappointing. I'm only averaging 22-23 MPG with about 70% highway driving. At any rate, no matter how good the rest of the car is, you can't wait to get out of it at the end of every trip longer then 15 minutes, so what good is it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tilt and telescope steering wheel. In brief, riding the back seats are actually quite comfortable, ironically.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Where do I start? There is a surge in vehicle when you drive when it switches back and forth from 6CL to 3CL (which is constantly). The brakes have squeaked from almost day one. My dealership told me 1st I was braking too hard, then I was braking too soft and then it was because of the gravel road I had to drive on to get to my house (about 50 yards). It's funny I never had that problem with my Toyota's. Now they are telling me that Honda acknowledges a problem with the brakes but now we have to wait for a service bulletin to be released. In the meantime I am making a monthly payment on a car that is embarrassing to drive. I will never buy Honda again!!! Oh yea, and the road noise...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is a good looking car. I like where all the buttons are on the dash and the steering column. The leather is soft and the back seat is nice and roomy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, I am enjoying this 2009 EX-L, with auto. It is very roomy on the inside. I can fit, even with a sunroof, at 6'4". It drives very smoothly and handles well. It's by no means, too firm. It soaks up bumps very well. As for the seats, contrary to others, I find them to be quite comfortable and very supportive. The headrest does not bother me at all. In fact, it actually raises up high enough to provide a rest for my head. It doesn't protrude too far forward. The 4 cyl is peppy. The V6 has a lot more power, but the 4 is sufficient for my needs. The downsides are that it lacks a trip computer, no shiftable auto, fog lights are an aftermarket extra and no power passenger seat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handles smoothly, good mpg, roomy, nice stereo system with XM, sub, etc. No pretense whatsoever. Hopefully it will be reliable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car is nice but definitely has a loud engine. I realized that it's more horsepower than some of the other models so that may be why. The steering wheel and seats are not very comfortable but the car itself is very nice looking and has a lot of features. Very disappointed with the amount of noise. When we bought we were told the 4cylinder is as good as the 6 cylinder. That's really not true and I'm sure they have a lot more 4 cylinders to sell. The 6 is a lot quieter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just returned from a 2,300 mile trip. We got 30.25 mpg which is what the sticker says. I also have a 2007 Chevrolet Impala with a 3.9L that gets 29.0 plus driving 27 miles each way to work. Not satisfied with the car. Lots of road noise, not a comfortable ride and less than expected gas mileage. I was told I should expect mileage in the mid 30's. Very disappointed after reading all of the Honda hype prior to purchase. Unless something changes, this will be my first and last Honda Accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 250,000 miles on my 1994 Honda accord. I bought a new silver 4dr 2009 LX in Feb 09, So far I'm pretty happy with the car. I have taken a couple of long trips and there are no issues with the seats to me. The AC is ICE cold and the 4 cyl has enough power for my use. The down side is the cheap plastic doors and dash material, lights flicker at night and the loud road noise. But for under 20Gs I'm very happy with the buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Accord coupe. I have owned a 2003 and 2006 4CYL. this time I decided on the 2009 V6. It is definitely fun to drive. I look forward to my daily commute. The V6 is powerful and responds immediately, especially if you drive it in D3. The one major complaint I have is the road noise. It seems inherent in all the coupes. Don't know if it is a problem in Sedans. HONDA... please do something about the road and wind noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Honda for 8months now and thought I would relay my remarks. I currently have 10.5k miles. Now I'm a pretty picky man and take attention to detail. The Honda took my expectations above and beyond. Nothing broke or had I had a problem with. It did well in the Chicago winter with heated mirrors and the defrosters are placed well. I love this car. I am getting paint chips but I do ride on the Highways mostly. For those that complain about road noise get better/bigger tires - I hear no noise with the stock 18' low profile tires. Those that complain about the seat, well I never have a problem, perhaps my model has a better seat. Great car - I expected to ride this into the ground at 200k+.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aux jack hidden in glove dept, garage link opener, heated everything, performance on the V6 (don't complain if your car is slow when you drive a 4 banger), ride quality, head room is more than a denali, back seat is as big as a two door car (I have a coupe), trunk space is big for a coupe, LOVE IT!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car back in March and got a heck of a deal, but I have been very disappointed by the quality, noise, and most of all the VCM technology. This car looks awesome from the outside and has decent interior, but Honda needs to go back to a simple engine and have a 6 speed automatic for fuel economy. The VCM is constantly hunting and car jerks when its coming to a stop. The automatic transmission can't keep up with a sporty drive and the handling is to tight for my taste. I was sold on looks and should have gotten into a more solid all around car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my new Honda accord for 3 months. Everything is Ok, but not as good as I expected. The worse thing is it gives so much noise, especially on the local road. I have visited the service twice already. I had read some reviews, it seems the noise is a common issue for this model of car. The seats are a little too hard for those who do not weigh so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Accord has a very uncomfortable seat. Actually, it is the worst of any in its class for comfort as I have test driven all the cars in the class. The acceleration is top notch. The transmission shifting is smooth. You have excellent visibility and a nice interior layout. The brakes are by far the worst in the class as evidenced by all the reviews, but most people will not notice this (I did). The build quality is very good, however, the paint job as noted by some others is not top notch. This car has hard springs and a rough ride compared to an Altima, Fusion, Camry or Sonata. For those who like a sporty, fun to drive car, this is a nice car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling on this car is top notch. I like how traction and stability control are standard for 2009. Nice selection of options. You will not have to buy a $2000 navigation system to get fog lights unlike the Altima.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased an Accord V6w/nav; white with beige leather interior and paid $26,700. (This is our fifth Accord). Car rides well; the interior layout is attractive. Seats are comfortable and adjustable; steering column and wheel adjusts fine. The nav. system includes a trip computer that calculates mileage. Averaging 24 MPG combined city and highway. Highway mileage was 28 MPG. Power steering pump broke after 400 miles; dealer said that was extraordinary and replaced it under the warranty. (That explains my low build quality rating.) There is a lot to learn about the car concerning nav system, Bluetooth, voice commands etc. Too much is made about the road noise; the road noise is fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Accord. Had an 04 & 07, both leases that had navi. I went without navi to save money this time. Definitely miss the leather but got such a good deal, I don't mind because it's another lease. Love the upgraded engine and more room. The seats are a little wider and boxier. But not uncomfortable as others have said. The road noise is the same as the 07. I've test driven the Altima, Camry and Malibu. No car in this class blows me away but the Accord has the most pros than cons. If I could afford to, I would buy an Acura or Infiniti. On highway driving I get about 29 mpg. This car gives you the most for your dollar.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a VW Jetta for the past 5 years I looked at a number of cars in the same price range and found the ride quality, build, and features of the Honda Accord the best value for money that I could find. For a mid-sized sedan, the Accord feels larger than any other car I had looked at in its price range and has a high quality build finish comparable to BMW. For real world use, the car performs well on any road, with study handling. I like the look and feel of the interior, but like other reviewers have found that it is easy to scratch & the controls do take a little getting used to; especially if you've not driven a Honda rec. There is plenty of room and storage areas throughout. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this Accord for 7 months and overall it's a very nice car. The interior is roomy, plenty of shoulder and leg room. The ride and handling are crisp with a bit of European flavor to it, though it falls just short of the total experience. The sound system is OK but tends to be shrill at times. Gas mileage has been acceptable but not particularly notable. The seats are firm, and at first I didn't care for them, but after a while I learned to appreciate that the firmness is really part of the overall ride and handling and you feel more attuned and attached to the driving experience. Acceleration is middling but OK. Smooth and almost transparent shifting. Great car for commuting. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's always the little things that count the most; having an AUX outlet for the iPod and having the 12V power outlet in the center glovebox. XM radio built-in is nice. An outside temp display, a monitor/reminder for oil changes and the low tire pressure monitor are also a plus. Auto up/down windows.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this car as the least expensive option that satisfied all our needs (wants). Mechanically, it's been A+ so far. We got the standard for one last "hooraw" before we qualify for AARP. It's fun to drive, but now we remember why we went to an automatic to begin with (hard to hold your coffee and switch gears at the same time). Gas mileage is actually better than advertised, but we're relatively light-footed drivers. Have one "cheap plastic" finish issue on the interior and a couple "question marks" on the trunk set-up, but the suspension is tight and takes country roads beautifully. I would have liked the universal remote, but you had to get the next package for $1K more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension and road handling, XM radio is fun to play with for those that aren't tech savvy. Steering wheel controls work very well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2003 Camry. Went to get it back in 3 days but was sold. Accord drives like a sport car with lots of interior noise. You feel all small bumps in the road. The steering wheel does not have a comfortable spot for my large hands. Is fun to drive around town but lacks power when you step on it. When you let off the gas it is like you down shifted, the car slows itself. Weird!! The brakes squeak from the day I bought it. Stops good but the squeak is annoying. </TEXT>
