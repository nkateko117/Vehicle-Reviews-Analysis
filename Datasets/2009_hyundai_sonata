<TEXT>Just bought my Sonata 5 days ago. traded a 2003 Mazda 6 s. The Sonata has been better than I could have hoped. Nice interior, quiet(except suspension), good stereo and very pleasant road manners. What really has been a surprise is the gas mileage. I used 5.25 gallons for 202 miles. That is better than 38 mpg and it was mixed driving and a new engine. I did have the dealership replace the original oil with synthetic before taking delivery</TEXT>

<TEXT>After less than 1000 miles the car started pulling to the left on any road or highway which isn't perfectly level. Speed doesn't matter-at low speeds the steering wheel make a 45 degree turn to the left, on highway I can merge into the left lane by just letting go of it. Took it to the dealership 4 times, alignment is ok, rotated the tires but still no difference. Dealership checked with Hyundai if this is a known problem and said it isn't (?). Of course, they say they can't do much more than that. Never had this problem with my 2 chevys and 08 Santa Fe on the exact same roads. Obviously, this car has suspension and steer design flaws. At least mine is a smooth and quiet ride on any kind of street.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Sonata after looking at Nisson and Honda and the best buy for the money was the Sonata. I have a heavy foot on the gas and still get 32 mg on the highway. The best I ever got from my Toyota was 29. The warranty is limited you have to read the fine print.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All good, finding new things on this machine every time out. Found take off in automatic a little hesitant but not used to drag race, so ok. Did a little research anyway reading tech data. It makes since to me why now. Drive train is made to get max fuel economy w/fare amount of horses. Using same 3.3L v6 added cvvt, new injection system boosted HP and MPG + Shiftronics all new f/2009. Trans has special valve to somewhat control RPM surge in auto mode manual side no valve 1st geared lower. You control RPM's. Better jump, don't hit car in front. Good f/ city driving. Also car has timing chain not stupid belt. Traction control is great when rain puddles on hiway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Now I guess shiftronics & traction control is high on my list. All options on new SE model are very pleasing for functional and visual effect. Sonata is engineered and built in the USA even engine and drive train.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first new car. Read a lot of reviews. Had a great deal (rebate) + winter tires and other free goodies. Had it for 5 months and nearly 10k km on it. Went on a trip to Boston from Montreal and the car ran perfectly well. Very comfortable and roomy. Gas mileage on road is greater than expected. Bit disappointed for city mileage though. Had a burned tail light and the small door speaker unglued itself on the first month but got them fixed right away. No biggies. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 Speakers system + USB/IPOD = AWESOME. Good gaz mileage on road. Mixed leather/cloth seats is a great idea. Very large trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Less then 1400 miles, one of the first things I did was change the air filter to K&N, seeing 23 MPG in town, on the road I don't know yet but some mixed with mostly town 26. More than enough pick up to get out of the way and starting in 1st. Very roomy, good seats and driving position, wish the seat bottom was a little longer but on any car I do. Easy to read gauges, very strong brakes and great audio system. Of course the best warranty in the business doesn't hurt. Easy to get the steering wheel where you like with both tilt and telescopic. Wasn't really that hot about leather or the moon roof but I'm finding I was quite wrong.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio system very easy to use with very little looking for where's that button. Wife wishes for a cassette player but her car has one and I have no use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just took a 2500 mile vac trip and had good millage thru out. Total ave. was about 29 mpg. I was disappointed with the harsh suspension due to the narrow profile tires it has. You do feel every pot hole. The drivers seat should have more back travel for leg clearance to exit from the car. The arm rest could extend forward a little farther for comfort. The blue trip scan gauge is very hard to read when lights are not used during the day and it is real bright out side. Color should be either orange or green. Slight hesitation on acceleration is very annoying.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good value and mpg and safety features for the money spent. Infinity sound system with the 6 cd changer is excellent. I am going to enjoy the heated seats in the Mn. winter around the corner. Auto trans. shifting is very smooth. Most importantly is the fact it has a timing chain instead of a belt.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was renting a Sonata GLS that was thru the insurance for 30 days as my car was totaled. I was impressed with the car and since I test drove a 2009 Sonata GLS for a month, I talked myself into buying a Sonata Limited 2009 w/o Nav. I paid $4375 below factory invoice that includes the 3000 rebate. Driving experience- suspension could be better, but no biggie. Everyone talks in the reviews of great MPG (30-34) on highways. I have not seen much written about city MPG. Mine is around 19-20 MPG in City driving which is not that impressive. Hope it improves as the car just finished the break in period. On freeway it is 30- 32 and as soon as I get off the ramp it drops to 20-21 in just 10 miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good value for money. No other manufacturer could beat it. I was a Nissan guy and have 2 Altimas 1998 and 2005. I'm glad I made Sonata as my 3rd car purchase. I gave up the brand loyalty as it was just paying too much and getting too little.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven Camrys for the past 10 years so it took quite a leap of faith for me to purchase a new 2009 Sonata Limited. But after comparison shopping there was no contest. I got a great deal on my Sonata (especially with the $3000 rebate on 2009 Sonatas), the dealership could not have been easier to work with (I run from high-pressure sales folks)and the car I bought has a lot of very nice features, including a V-6, leather interior, sunroof, great stereo and a very nice, quiet ride, plus excellent warranties. For the same price I paid for a new Sonata with all those features I would have had to buy a used Camry, Accord or Altima (and right around 2007 or even 2006 for the same features.)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior space is excellent. I am a big guy, over 6'2" and have several inches to spare above my head, especially with the sunroof. I also am very surprised by the handling, which is very smooth, and the engine, which has plenty of pep when I need it. My wife and I also love the heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just finished a 6K mile trip out west. The car performed great. Got between 28 and 37 MPG. The 28 was doing a steady 81 with AC. The 37 was doing around 55. Couldn't have asked for more of 175 horses. I enjoyed the trip. The car was quiet, and we enjoyed the radio and music using a memory stick.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Can't say I really had any favorite features. We enjoyed the quietness, comfort and fuel economy. I typically get around 29-30 mpg at home in mixed driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car used with 11k miles on it. It has the option premium package with moon roof, automatic lights, trip computer, electric seat. Got a great deal and now I can see why: this car is fine on the highway and if that is all you basically do then fine, buy it. But if most of your driving is in town, on any road less than perfect then forget it. It is one constant busy, bumpy, and thunky ride with every imperfection in the road transmitted through the inferior suspension put into this car. After a week of this nonsense I finally had enough and took it back for another car. Fortunately, the dealer allowed me to trade it without penalty. Be warned, this car is terrible on city streets</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car a year ago and have written two reviews, one when I first got the car, and then another at six months. This will be my final review at a year old. I'm sorry to say, but I now understand why Hyundai is not considered the same in quality as the leading Japanese manufactures. Not only have I detailed a number of options missing that the competitors offer, but numerous problems have reared their ugly head in the past year. The 09 Sonata is a nice car, but it's priced right where it should be. After my year experience with the car, I understand why Hyundai does not have the resale value of the Japanese as well. Hyundai has made great strides, but they have a ways to go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is still the velvety highway ride. That's where the compliments end however. These problems have all surfaced in the first year: very harsh shifting transmission, navigation system freezing up, dash making cracking noises as it expands and contracts with changes in temperature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my car since September last year, and I've put a little over 8000 miles on it since. Though it's over 6 months old, it still brings a smile to my face when I walk out to it. What it boils down to, is that you can't get a better car for the price. The standard features beat the competitors in its class hands down, even at a lesser cost. Comfort, size, safety... all excellent. Not quite as "sporty" as the Accord, but more luxurious... so it's a price I gladly pay. I tend to have a lead foot, as the saying goes, so my fuel economy suffers... but that aside, I don't feel I get decent MPG. I've gotten compliments from, literally, everyone who's been in my car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Warranty! Of course. Zippy V6, sexy exterior, 6 disk MP3 player, built in USB and aux, 6.1 speaker stereo system, clean attractive interior, how do I pick? I guess my favorite thing is that it's mine all mine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased for size, economy, manual option and warranty. I have drive Subarus for 30 years but the Legacy is much smaller,and has poorer mileage (due to AWD). I have 6k in mileage; On recent trip to Kentucky I got 32.5MPG going around 70- 75mph. The only complaints I have are the manual trans is not as positive is shifting compared to Subaus I have owned and also Honda Accouds/Civics and Mazadas I have driven which are owned by family members. (Even my 86 year old mother drives a Civic with a stick shift!)Hope the trans gets smoother as it breaks in; MPG has increased. Another strange issue is that when back windows are down at highway speed that there is a loud wind noise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Hyundai and my third Sonata and they just keep getting better and better. the new 4 cyl. has plenty of power but does it's business without harshness or excessive noise. Ride quality has improved noticeably and road and wind noise levels have improved. Haven't had it long enough to log my mpg. Will come back when that's sorted out. The exterior changes this year are minimal and add only a little to the already pleasant design. This car's forte is the new interior. Beautiful, quiet, comfortable, spacious about sums it up. Kudos to whoever designs their interiors! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I replace my 2005 Chevy impala with this car. My car payment went down $ 100 a month and I feel I got a better car. It 175 hp vs 200 it fills as quick and the ride's better. Gas mileage on Chevy 16 to 28 / Hyundai 21 town 33 at 75 on highway. Love the ride and the head room I'm 6,3 lot of room in back for the kid's the dealership treat me like I got a BMW. I sold Honda's for 6 month and Hyundai has them worried if I didn't know it I would think I was diving a Honda accord. And not the Honda accord vp this car way better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the stuff you get on the base car, all safety features, mp3 hook up or lap top, tilt wheel, one push driver door, power Windows. Big gas tank less time at gas station drove from ky to on one tank of gas my other car's would have to fill up one or two times on the trip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When we picked up the car the navigation was not hooked up correctly and the dealer "fixed" it for us, but it took three days (signs of bad things to come). Less than a month later we took it to North Carolina and the nav system went out again. Dealer there was helpful and put in a new one for us. 8 months later it is not working again. It si a great car, but I would not spend the extra for the nav system-they are not real helpful in getting it fixed and even when calling the help line they are not good at letting us know what is being done to remedy the problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been test driving/researching cars for 3 weeks prior to my purchase. I test drive the base models (cloth seats, nothing extra) of all the following: The Hyundai beat the pant off of the other cars I drove in price and quality. Incredible interior/cloth seats/value. Toyota Camry Tight steering, responsive engine, cheap dash, especially the knobs. Seats average, cloth on door arm rest worn at 30,000 miles in every car I drove. Used 2008/2009 Camry @ 35,000 miles costs more than a brand new 2009 Hyundai. Ford Fusion Absolutely horrible, disgusting, uncomfortable. Small leg width space, ugly dash, center console, very uncomfortable seats because of the headrests. This is one of the worst.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a 2007 Ltd and this 2009 GLS was purchased for my mom. I can tell you that based on my experiences, the suspension was meant to be soft. It's not a flaw, BUT it's something that will not give joy to everyone who drives one. People used to tighter suspensions..shop elsewhere. What I do have an issue with is the tires. They do not absorb bumps very well. The 17" wheels are worse than the 16" on the GLS. This is not a problem with suspension or shocks. The Kuhmo tires are harsh and noisy. Invest in better tires if it's that bad for you. Also check the tire pressure and make sure they're set as they should. Over/under inflated tires can make a huge difference in ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design is worlds better than my 2007 Ltd. The 16" tires absorbs bumps a lot better than my Ltd. I just checked the mileage and it currently reads 26mpg, which is much better than what I'm getting on my V6 (21mpg). Also, Sonatas DO get better mileage the longer you drive it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Altima and Mazda6 are sportier, the Camry and Accord have better resale value, but nothing in the <25k price range beats the Sonata for value, comfort and technolust. Standout features - - iPod integration: The aux+USB interface can charge your ipod, and you can browse artists, playlists, albums etc on the display. The wheel mounted controls can be used to ffwd, rewind and play next / previous songs. No need to touch the ipod once its plugged in. - Hood and trunk have struts. No chance of the hood dropping on your head, no need to move stuff out the way of the trunk's hinges. - The console and interior styling belong to a luxury car - superb sound system. Crystal clear treble, deep base</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall great car! I don't like the latch you have to pull out and push in to tilt the steering wheel, other cards I've owned you just move the latch; move the wheel, and let go, this you have to push the latch for it to engage the wheel in place. (small item but bothersome). A small amount of road noise, but then I can never tell the difference in noise from 25 mph or 70 mph. Great acceleration.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This will make the 6th Hyundai product that I haved owned since 2003, my last Hyundai before the 2009 sonata was a 2006 sonata se v6. This time around I choose the 4 cylinder more for the economy purpose of the car. I am pleasantly surprised with the power and the changes that been made with the 2009 model. I now own the 2009 sonata limited and I think it blows away my previous car a 2007 Nissan altima 2.5sl.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not one to buy on price by can't ignore the value of the Sonata. Mind you will lose it on resale so not quite the bargain it seems. Interior is best in class for me. Materials not quite as good as Accord but layout way better. Seats fairly comfortable, quiet ride. 249hp plenty for me - I don't understand the need for 270+ in a fwd family car. Fortunately seem to not have the suspension noise problem (and roads are horrible here right now) and tranny shifts OK. Chassis simply not as sophisticated and composed as Accord or Mazda6. Seems chassis itself is not stout enough and the flex leads to some unsteadiness at speed despite stiff suspension. So far so good - hope it lasts!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design. Easily worked radio with XM and USB. Actually like deep cup holders (I don't drink coffee). Heated 8-way power seat. Quiet ride, smooth power. Large lined trunk, trunk and hood on struts (ahem Honda). Easy access to items like oil filter, washer filler, etc. Price!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving this car for over 8000 miles, I'm still pleased with what a tremendous value it is. GLS has all the options you need with popular equip. pkg. Pretty powerful for a 4 cylinder while getting great mileage for a car this size - 27 mpg mixed city/highway. Originally thought about civic/corolla/elantra, but this car was a class up for the same price (with incentives). Great interior! Very quiet car. ESC works great in the snow. Manually shifting the automatic works OK, but upshifts are slow. Also, it tends to downshift from 5th to 4th on even the slightest hill in cruise control on the freeway. Oh well. Seats could use more lateral support when cornering. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash lighting and layout look great, standard iPod/USB jack. Steering wheel audio controls are nice. Very roomy interior - this thing is huge! 5 speed auto with manual shifting. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Narrowed down my purchase to a Jetta or the Sonata and the Sonata just blew the Jetta away with features and lower cost. I also found the Sonata to be extremely comfortable with a very smooth ride. The iPod connectivity is great although there are some quirks with the software that could be improved. They also need to make the center console just a tad bigger to be able to hold a normal iPod well. The one area I have not been impressed with is gas mileage. I have routinely gotten about 22 MPG even with a good bit of highway driving. Not as good as I hoped, but still much better than what I had before.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Should have paid more for a car to have a decent ride, these Kumho tires are stiff and out of round, when cold the tires are worse! Doors unlock when car put into park so someone can jump into back seat and hijack someone. Nice feature with child lock for rear doors, but even when that is on someone can open the outside doors and get in...scary for my wife when she is alone.

<TEXT>Was tired of noisy poky 4 cyl cars and decided to go for broke with a top of the line midsized V6. With gas at $4 a gallon, had second thoughts about the V6. Test drove the Sonata SE and was impressed. With the Limited V6 priced about 6K less than the Camry XLE or Honda EX, decided to go for broke and use the savings for gas. Now that the price of gas has come down, I'm delighted with the choice. Wife mostly drives it and loves it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V6 provides more than enough power in all situations. Suspension smooths out city bumps very nicely, car rides quietly, the interior is comfortable, controls are well organized. Pay one price and every available option is included except navigation. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My extended family and I have been buying/leasing Chrysler Products for almost 10 years from the same salesman who recently began selling the cars made by HYUNDAI. A couple of weeks after he got to the new store Lee called my wife and I about this SONATA. I must say that although we never really paid attention to the brand before, we are each impressed. for the cost of an entry level Dodge Avenger we have more standard feature's. A far more quiet ride. A great deal more room. We also looked at a few of the other cars offered by Hyundai, after meeting a very considerate owner. We now are driving a wonderful new car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at the Sonata, Camary, Accord and Malibu on paper the Sonata appeared to be the best bang for the buck. Little did I realize that the bang would be felt over every bump in the road. There is a bad engineering flaw with the suspension of these cars. I do not know how anyone could be satisfied with the ride of a Sonata. I wish I had taken a longer test drive. I am stuck with a car that sounds like the shocks bottom out over every little bump in the rode.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove the Camry and Altima, the Sonata gives you the most for the dollar by far. For 1-2 grand less the the other cars, you get leather interior, xm radio, moon roof, individual temp controls and excellent interior trim and alloy wheels. Entertainment controls on the steering wheel. Not quite as quick as the Altima off the line, but adequate power (my last car was a turbo) Huge trunk. The oil filter is on the right way so when change the oil, you won't get an oil bath (surprising how many cars have the oil filter upside down) Smooth ride. I didn't experience any suspension noise going over bumps and highway speeds were just great driving. Dash is well laid out with easy to find controls</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the bells and whistles in the interior for way less money then the other brands. Hyundai has come a LONG way in quality. Great warranty 10 year 100k mile drive train, 5 year 50k roadside assistance. Can't do better for the money</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First of all, this car is a BARGAIN right now; I paid much less than Edmunds' TMV price; $4,500 under sticker! This is our 4th Hyundai; 3rd brand new. My wife is driving an 07 Santa Fe; loves it. I had an 03 Elantra GT - LOVED that car, but traded it so my wife could have the SF (cry). This Sonata is even better than the GT; incredible power, nice interior styling and comfort (partial leather seats are very comfortable and supportive); and I think the standard stereo/CD is very good. Some call the styling vanilla: I call it Hyundai's Sonata 'Audi' (the last Sonata was trying to be a Jaguar - this one succeeds better!). I also looked at the 09 Mazda6 and Malibu LTZ; chose this one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PRICE! Power seat comfort; V6 engine torque; clean sharp ext. & int. styling; color (Willow Grey); handling, visibility; storage space galore! power outlets; 17" alum. 5- spoke wheels; driver ergonomics; quiet interior; stereo (really, it's fine!); my secretary has a Camry; I like this much better! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had this car going on 6 mos now. Have a little over 3000 mi. Have not had any problems to date. I was waiting to update my review until I had driven it in the snow. It did not disappoint me. The traction control & ESC seem to do just what they were designed to do. And the Shift Tronic feature is helpful, so you can use engine braking to slow the vehicle down on slippery roads. This car continues to impress me. Im averaging 32-33 mpg. If I get "Sporty" and use the Shift Tronic a lot. I'll drop down to 26-28 mpg. I honestly cant think of anything I don't like about it after 6 mos.</TEXT>

Unless you got to have leather and sunroof etc etc..you can not beat the deal!! Even if you bought the top of the line limited your still ahead of the other makes. Car has plenty of power. Great gas mileage. Rides smooth and quiet. Build is superb. Only 2 minor glitches is headlights cast a weird line due to the projector headlights and motor has gotten louder since new but not something i would rush to the dealer for. Do your math and for 18K...good luck finding better priced in the same field!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Following up an initial review, I now have 10,500 miles on the car after returning from a 2500+ mile trip to Ohio in December. Needless to say,we experienced a mix of terrible winter weather, including freezing rain and snow, and the anti lock brakes and stability control performed flawlessly; this car is safe, stable, stops and handles great under all conditions. I deliberately slammed the brakes on on a deserted road covered with several inches of snow over ice, and the car stopped without swerving or fishtailing at all. I never wished for more power, even on long mountain upgrades, and the mileage was 28-30 mpg overall.</TEXT>

For the price I got my car for I could not pass it down. The car has a very soft ride which I had read about. But not too bad. Car engine seems much better in Shiftronic mode than in normal drive mode. Can't write much at the moment since the car is still pretty much brand new. </TEXT>

Even with my wife's heavy foot, the car still gets 24mpg in town and we get 32 on the highway loaded down for a trip going 70mph. My GLS did not come with the auto on/off headlights but you can still leave the headlights turned on all the time and they will go off when you turn the engine off and remove the key. If you have BMW taste then do not consider this car. But if value means more to you than people judging you by the coolness of your car, then the Sonata is for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning the 2006 and 2007 Sonata Limited during the past, I was amenable to test driving the 2009 based upon several auto magazine reviews and 60,000 combined driving miles. My 2009 Sonata Limited ranks among the very best autos(including Mercedes, BMW's, Infinity Q45 etc) that I have driven during the past 40 years. The ride is exceptional smooth, handling secure, road noise non-existent, braking responsive without fade, and highway entrance acceleration terrific! The interior is well appointed,and XM radio stations crisp. In addition, my combined gas mileage is over 26 mph,and, I often approach 31 mph on highway driving. My only two complaints are the navigation system & blue odometer.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I was initially impressed with this car, especially the price which was $16,000 cash, automatic, and nothing else. I was in route to the Honda dealer but I passed by Hyundai and asked for a test drive. I should have kept going. The mileage is greatly overrated, at least in my view. I have not achieved better than 18-19 MPG. It dos not shift very well and remains in lower gears too long. The ride quality is equally overstated. I feel every bump and pothole. It is a smooth ride only on well maintained roads. Otherwise the ride is very harsh. The build quality is not the greatest. I have noticed rattles and noises even on minor bumps. As I said, I should have kept going. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I took my time in my search for new sedan to replace the wife's Saturn SL2, driving just about everything available under $25K. Our main criteria were: 1) larger and more comfortable than the SL2 (I'm 6'4"), 2) automatic transmission, 3) 4-cylinder for respectable gas mileage (our weekly commuting is 250+ miles), 4) leather seats, 5) power adjustable driver's and passenger's side mirrors. After driving a dozen or so cars, I cut my list down to the VW Jetta, Mazda 6, Saturn Aura, Nissan Altima, and the Sonata. I think I would have been happy with any of these, but when the price was factored in, it became no contest with the Sonata beating them all by $2500-$4500.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove a Camry, Accord, Nissan 2.5s and Mazda 6, then Sonata last. I am a Toyota guy, or should I say "was". The Sonata was about $4k less at the start, has better quality interior, more HP under the hood, is quieter, and handles better than the Camry. It is not quite as crisp as the other three, but it is a different drive. And it is so quiet inside, nicely designed. So, Toyota, I am now a Hyundai guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car to replace one of our 2006 Hyundai Accents. We're very impressed with the interior size as well as the interior furnishings and finish. I picked the four cylinder for the highway mileage and haven't driven enough yet to get some good figures. I'm very pleased with this car so far and can see myself fighting with the wife to see who gets to drive on a given day. The five-speed automatic transmission is great. Drives and shifts smoothly. It will tend to downshift while going uphill at highway speeds, especially with the cruise control on. You have been warned! I suppose that's one of the trade offs for the EPA 32 mpg highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had to replace automatic on and off light sensor did not work when purchased. Carpet had to be replaced because of rips. After car warms up transmission shifts very roughly between 1st and 2nd gears and sometimes between 2nd and 3rd. I was told that the transmission was an inter active unit and would soon smooth out after the break in period. The car has over 6000 miles now and nothing has changed since the day I purchase it. Also it emits a foul rubbery smell from the heating or air vents. Smells like air coming out of a tire. If steering is turned to quickly to either lock position car will cut off.

<TEXT>Went to a local auto show to look at buying a Camry, Accord, Altima, or Malibu. I kept going back to look at the Sonata vs the other cars and concluded it was every bit as well built for thousands less. I did some more research and bought the Sonata. If all the cars were the same price I still would have picked the Sonata. The fact that it was thousands less was just a bonus and it has a warranty that the others won't even attempt to compete with. The car drives very nice and is very comfortable and quiet. The 4 cyl. engine delivers more than adequate performance and on a recent highway trip I got over 35 mpg. Great Car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We went to World Car Hyundai/Nissan. We test drove a base Sonata with an option package and we weren't totally adverse to the experience, but we didn't like the interior fabric, the paint color, or the cheapo wheels. The dealer was running a sale this particular day, it was also coincidentally the end of the month and it turns out that's a very good time to buy a new car. I found a silver blue metallic Sonata Limited with the four cylinder and they had a sale price on it of $21,699. Wow, I thought. This is a nice car. In conjunction with $2,000 customer cash from Hyundai, we paid $2,225 less than invoice. Good negotiators might still beat that price.</TEXT>

I am getting just under 30 mpg on the highway and low 20's in town. Considering my last infiniti was just over 50k loaded and I could have bought 2 of these with money left over its an amazing deal.

<TEXT>I spent 4 months researching cars to replace my beloved GMC Envoy (SUV). Everything else was too small, or overpriced, or didn't have stability control. And while I had my mind set on a 4 cylinder SE (for the price and fuel economy), a V6 came along as a dealer demo with 9500 miles on it. Thus, it was cheaper than a "new" 4 cylinder and now I have a car with a super-powerful and smooth, unbelievably quiet engine. The car now has nearly 11,000 miles on it with no rattles. I'm averaging 24 mpg on my 12 mile suburban commute. I got 35 mpg on an all-highway trip. Great in the mountains. Great looks, super comfortable, very modern. Beats every car I've owned, including a Passat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So as the economy riddles us all, I decide to purchase a fuel efficient low cost vehicle, low priced and one that will be reliable, boy did I make a mistake. I purchased 2009 sonata gls, the suspension is horrible, my transmission makes a slight rattle, I have creaking noises coming from my interior and I have only 1000 miles. The service manager and mechanics of course cannot locate the problems and are telling me that the noises will go away with time ? are you kidding me. I think everyone who is incurring these problems should create a petition forward it to Hyundai and take care of the issues.

Drove the Camry and the Sonata blew it away in comfort and styling. Only knock is slight hesitation in acceleration after decelerating. Nav performs great and much smaller than most vehicles and touch screen a plus, Bluetooth has good performance. The fit and finish is far superior than the 2008 Sonata.

<TEXT>When I decided on a Sonata it was after many hours of research and test drives. I've had the Sonata for a couple of months now and have been more than happy. My gas mileage has been better than the EPA (about 26/34) and it has had plenty of power when I've needed it. I'm not going to win many races but it gets the job done in every day traffic. I'm 6'4", and 250lbs. and the Sonata has been plenty big and very comfortable to drive in the city and long trips (I've taken two). The interior is well designed and well laid out and the 2009 Sonata has a seat that's about and inch longer than the previous year, and that has made a massive difference in overall comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I considered the Honda Accord & Toyota Camry before deciding on the Hyundai. The most noticeable features which impressed me were the whisper-quiet interior and feature-rich Limited package. The Honda accord had nicer exterior stying and better handling, but for the thousands of dollars more for equivalent features, was simply not worth it. As others have noted, the suspension needs tweaking- it leans noticeably in corners, and shock absorption on rough roads ruins the otherwise quiet isolation in the cabin. Overall, it's an excellent value for someone looking for a refined luxury ride with exception power from the 3.1L V6 engine. Overall, I'm very satisfied.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 09 Sonata GLS Manual with the intent to save money, not be inconvenienced every month. During the 8 months I have owned the vehicle it has died multiple times, starting at 1205 miles. The problem was traced to a faulty O2 sensor, but has had a skip and hesitation ever since. When I insisted the issue be solved, the lead mechanic said it was normal and they all do that. At 12000 miles the vehicle was blowing clutch slave cylinders every 2-300 miles, which required removal of the transmission to get to. After the fourth one was replaced and the vehicle being in the shop for an accumulated 58 days, I sought legal help because Hyundai would not return my calls. Can't recommend it</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have 2500 miles on my sonata SE V6 so far but all is good. I traded a 2003 Corolla Le in for it. I loved the Corolla but wanted something a little bigger with more horsepower with good MPG. So far the Sonata has given me everything I asked for. driving around Chicago in stop and go I get 23 MPG on the freeways at 75 MPH i get 34 Mpg. Can't complain about that. When you stomp it, it zooms past everybody. I like that feeling of being able to pass quickly. The ride is excellent and road noise is a minimum. Ergonomically everything fits and performs well, and the fit and finish is good. No complaints and wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my 06 Sonato with a V6 in on this one with the 4cyl.Had not one problem with it. The V6 has more power but the 4cyl may surprise you with the pickup it has,plus the gas mileage is a plus. Majority of my driving is freeway and I abide by the speed limits so I get better than advertised mileage.My model has everything but navigation, excellent ride, infinity sound system is excellent,large trunk,wife loves the heated seats,I enjoy the dual climate control.Car is a pleasure to drive.Compare it to other cars with the same equipment you will be saving money and have a great warranty to go along with it. Our dealership has also made ownership a pleasure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a new Limited with everything except nav system. Traded a Toyota Avalon and no regrets. Recently returned from a 2500 mile road trip and no problems. When not fighting a head wind, managed 32 mpg at 79 mph with the V6. Overall city around 22 mpg. This car has plenty of power and conveniences. Climate control works very well. Mostly quiet car except on textured, pebbled roads etc. (May change tires for quieter ride) Very little wind noise. Front buckets ok but a little short in the seat and leg room for a taller person. Can't stretch out legs when driving. Love the XM radio but expected a more refined sound from the Infinity system. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power when you need it (V6). Climate control ease of use. Build, fit and finish very good. Steering wheel controls. Big trunk space. Auto transmission in mountains is excellent - and fun!!! Mostly very quiet at lower speeds. Warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove the Altima, Accord, Jetta, and Kia and by far the Sonata was the best for features, cost and look of the car. Jetta and Accord drove a little better. I recommend getting the SE over the limited, the wheels, spoiler and options make it look better then the limited plus getting the Premium Package you end up with almost the same car as the limited but minus a few grand. I bargained down to 19,800 with premium package so dealers are motivated to sell. When it came down to it I had to decide between Accord and Sonata and the Accord just didn't have the features and cost more. Accord handled better but that was not enough to change my mind. I highly recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

I test drove a couple of Sonatas also. So I should have been happy with the car. However I didn't get to test drive the cars over bumpy roads. This car makes the worst noise over bumps I have ever heard. Every wheel on this car just bangs over almost every bump I hit. I did have the dealer check out the car. They said there wasn't anything wrong. I took one of the service guys out for a ride. I really couldn't demonstrate the noise. The roads in the area are smooth. I would not recommend buying a Sonata. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove both the Accord and Camry before deciding to purchase the Sonata. The Sonata drove smooth (>Accord, >=Camry) and had the quietest cabin while driving. Add the std safety features and the Sonata was a no brainer. Some people wrote they didn't care for the 2009's updated body lines, but I have a friend with a 2007 and I like the 2009 much better. The taller front grill (now chrome), larger, brighter headlights and overall more angular body lines give the 2009 a more aggressive look. I really like the new interior. The center console looks modern and sports blue lights and a new large display radio. Everything feels solid, esp the doors. Very quiet engine and while driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Hyundai Sonata I own makes noise like something is loose and the body is bouncing off the frame. It's steering and front end need to be redone. The car pulls to the left while driving on highways and when hitting even small road cracks has a jarring effect. Also while driving on smooth roads you can feel a pulsating in the steering wheel. All this still occurring after the front shocks were replaced last month.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote my first review the night I got my car home. Of course everyone loves a new car the day they buy it. Go read any Edmunds review and if often starts like this "Just got the car today, I LOVE it!!!" I'm here to tell you that six months later and it's still a joy to drive every day. It has been absolutely flawless in build quality and reliability. And just like another reviewer said, the car handles much better than "professional" reviews would lead you to believe. Powerful brakes that stop the car right now, a smooth, powerful V6 engine, and a suspension system that does a fantastic job of providing a velvety ride while also being sporty enough to have fun around the corners.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A V6 engine that is averaging 26 mpg in an even mix of hwy/city driving, an amazingly smooth highway ride (the miles melt away on the freeway), very quiet ride with hardly any wind/road noise, huge trunk, great sound system, very tight turning radius (great for U-turns), and classy looking exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fuel efficiency of this model was a major factor in my decision to go with Hyundai. After 6500 miles I am averaging 29 MPG around Huntsville, AL in mixed city/interstate driving. The interior of this car is laid out well. The power seat is great because it allows for small tweaks while driving to maintain driver comfort. The stock radio sounds very good and having the USB port allows me to play MP3s from a flash drive, and XM radio is a big plus too. The A/C cools quickly and has to be turned down a bit, even on hot days. The interior is so quiet that I feel like I'm in my own little zone on the way home from work each day.</TEXT>

We live in hot Florida and there were a few really hot humid days where the air just didn't seem to be good enough for me, but only around town,highway it is fine.

Handles better than reviews led me to believe. Gas mileage is great. Lots of interior room.

<TEXT>The car is decent on smooth roads but is no fun to drive on city streets that are not smooth as a table top. Too much suspension noise. When going over road patches and other road irregularities, the rear wheels/suspension make a noise that sounds like something is loose and the body is bouncing off the struts. Very embarrassing to have friends in the car with all this noise. All the dealer will say is that the stiff suspension is the cause. I say Nonsense. Also the radio on the AM dial has much static.

The warranty is also a plus, in addition to the excellent safety features that are standard. My wife and thoroughly enjoy driving our sonata and would recommend it to anyone.

<TEXT>Much improved over 2006 model. I was planning on more power, but NY dealers only sell the PZEV version with 168 HP instead of the 175 advertised all over. Interior is great looking. Ride is very comfortable, yet more sporty feeling. 5 speed transmission should shift at more appropriate times - car feels out of breath going 45 mph under light acceleration when it shifts into 5th. Makes me want to shift manually. TPMS I'm sure will come in handy. I don't care for revised front, but back looks better. Mileage has been between 27 and 29 mpg per tank with 30%+ heavy city driving (will improve once I add K&N filter). There is no more key hole for trunk - must use remote or latch inside car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My son has a 2006 Sonata which has been completely bulletproof, so when gas prices forced me to begin looking for an economical 4cyl, I started with the 2009 Sonata. Opening the door on the GLS for the first time, I was amazed at the beautiful, classy, high- quality interior that, yes, reminded me of a Lexus. The test drive was even more impressive; unbelievably quiet and smooth at 80mph, smooth-shifting automatic, little wind or road noise. I still test drove Accord, Camry, Altima, even Corolla, but none compared. I bought the Sonata because I liked it the best, not just because it was thousands of dollars cheaper.</TEXT>

Only sacrifice is in a bit of road feel handling - the Sonata is equal or better than the Accord in every other way. Ride is definitely smoother/quieter - a great highway car! Trip computer makes me a more efficient driver - 26 mpg city, 34-35 highway. Great safety features, including stability control, which was a requirement. Fit/finish, seating and interior space is wonderful, and all the standard equipment makes me feel like I've bought a luxury car. XM radio is fantastic, nav system is terrific.

<TEXT>I'm a 45 year old "conscientious consumer". I drove the Accord, Camry and the Sonata. They are all great cars. I'm convinced if they were to take the labels off the cars you could not tell the difference between them. I opted for the Sonata for two reasons; the warranty and the price. I paid $21,300 for the limited package with mud flaps, moonroof guard, rubber trunk liner and mesh trunk bag. You can't touch a loaded Accord or Camry for that price. Through 5 tanks of gas I've averaged 27, 27, 28, 27 and 27 MPG per tank. After 2,500 miles I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would challenge anyone purchasing a mid-sized sedan to drive the Sonata. It provides the best overall value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the stereo! The auto A/C works great and the dual zone a/c is a great feature. The interior is stylish and trim is nicely done. I love the front end.

<TEXT>Had the new sonata for 2 months now. Bought it with 50 miles on it and im just about to roll into 3k. Even with the stick version that I have, the car lacks any Punch when you hit the gas, but it more than makes up for it by its good handling around corners and smooth ride. Its Nice inside, the seats are supportive and comfortable (so unusual for some reason), and the base model features are just exellent. My only complaints so far is the lack of Punch (but who needs it in morning traffic) and even when riding the speed limit and 99% highway driving, I can never hit 30 mpg. I average about 27-28 real world highway. Its not bad, but its not the 32 advertised. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have purchased 15 new Japanese cars since 1978 - Mazdas, Nissans and Mitsubishi. This is my first Korean car. I must say that I am very impressed with the Sonata compared with the many Japanese cars I have bought in the past. Fit and finish are excellent, mileage is amazing (24.5 in the city, 34.5 on the interstate at 80MPH with the air conditioning). Many more standard features than most other brands and far less expensive. Most comfortable sedan I have ever owned. The warranty is far better than any Japanese manufacturer's. After 3800 miles, I've had no problems whatsoever. Although I've only owned the car for 3 months, I highly recommend the Sonata.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have only owned the Sonata for 1 month. Although the test drive was fine, the the front passenger seat became very uncomfortable on a longer road trip. Also, I recently drove the car in the country after dark, and it seemed like a curtain descended half way down the windshield. I had to turn on the highbeams to be able to see if an animal was in the road, and even then, I couldn't see the sides at intersections. The problem isn't bad on lighted city streets except for not being able to see around the corner at intersections. The dealer said that the lights are normal -- but I didn't have this problem with the Nissan, Ford or Chevy cars that we drove over the past 25 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in New England and purchased 2009 Sonata.Great winter performance. With only 15000 on the OD my Service Mgr. told me the brake pad backer plates are rusting and the corrosion is reducing the space between the pad and the rotor creating a potential safety problem of possibly glazing and having a brake loss or dragging and locking or burning. With the bumper to bumper warranty expired the the repair cost me $160 out of pocket. I was told the problem could re-occur. The expense is a minor irritation but the Prospect of losing my brakes on the Interstate or having them lock-up on an icey road is terrifying. Whats the big deal about a re-design of the pad. An alloy that doesn't rust.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart design looks great and traction control handles all road conditions superbly with excellent fuel economy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this vehicle after trading in a 2009 Honda CRV EX-L. Loved the Honda but tired of the SUV. The Hyundai is everything I expected except I have a noise under the dash that drives me crazy whenever I go over a speed bump or drive on a secondary road, I read about this noise in other owner reviews but was hoping it would not happen to me. My Honda never had a noise like this. It sounds like something is loose and it is a "plastic" like noise. I will ask my dealer to fix it during my first service. If he can't, I will really regret my purchase regardless of price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really like the interior design, the gray leather and silver exterior. Very quiet on the highways. MPG run around 27-29 using my own calculator. XM radio is superb. A nice car except see above and what follows. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After much research and comparisons we decided on the SE v6, this style gave us more standard options than any of the others. Plus several other options added at no extra charge, add in the warranty and it was a easy decision. It may have a little less horsepower rating than some of the top competitors but unless you buy it to drag race, or want to exceed 145 mph I think it is more than efficient. You get advantage of great gas mileage 32.5 hyway,would only wish I could have got that kind of mileage with my 63 Impala SS W/ SAME HP. BEATS OUR 2.5L V6 mAZDA by a long shot.Ride is awesome, quite, smooth and precise, interior is great. Find a better deal than this buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Hyundai after having 2 prior Hondas. Our XG350 was a better travel car, but our V6 Sonata handles better due to a less soft suspension and has 50hp more. Love the GPS and Bluetooth, as well as the standard 350 watt Infiniti sound system. Our onboard mpg computer pegs in-town at 22mpg, and generally 31-32 mpg on a flat, straight highway like I- 20. 5 year bumper-to-bumper and 10 year mechanical warranties will probably go unused.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've read a lot of these reviews, especially before I bought the Sonata. I am glad I did. For the money it is a great deal. The 32 mpg on the highway is right and that is with the AC on and 70 mph. It cruises nicely on the highway. Dash controls are easy and make sense. Back seat is roomy compared to others. Some reviews were unimpressed with handling, and it is a bit soft, but still very good. My only complaint is the suspension; it is clunky on a bumpy road. If Hyundai solves that issue they will have an unbeatable car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We've only had our Sonata (with automatic) about one month, but we are impressed. We took it on the road for over 1,300 miles and averaged from 38-42 mpg. It rides quietly and comfortably with excellent handling in both dry and very wet weather----no brake problems. The engine seems fully competent and responds well. All systems perform as advertised. Trunk space is wonderful and the fold-down rear seat backs provide a most spacious cargo area----big enough for us to carry an antique rocker----without sacrificing cabin quietness. Of course, we had limited time with the Sonata, but so far so very good! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We did all the research and had our minds set to purchase a 2008 Hyundai Elantra. But when we noted the small difference in price between the Elantra and the 2009 Sonata after discounts, we decided on the Sonata because of its roominess and stated difference of only one fewer mile per gallon highway. No mistake! This car is comfortable, quiet, and the most pleasurable car to drive I've ever experienced other than something really high priced. And even then, the difference is marginal. And what a surprise to put on 507 miles of around-town driving before dumping in 14.8 gallons of gas when the pump popped. XM radio and turn-down seats for extra storage also pluses we are happy with. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought car at the end of June. Have 4,200 miles on so far. Have had no problems, except once in a while on a warm day, the gas tank must get an air bubble or some type of vapor lock in it, because I have had three times when I went to fill it up with Gas, I could not fill it up. It would be about 2 or 3 gallons from being full. Dealership is no help in this issue. However when I can fill it up, Gas mileage has been excellent. Always over 30 MPG, except the two times I used Gas with Ethanol in it, and my MPG went down to 28. So the answer is use 100 percent Gas, none of that Ethanol crap. Lets DRILL DRILL DRILL.

<TEXT>All doors unlock when placed in park! Thieves and gangs will love this feature that puts all occupants at risk as soon as they park. Evidently the makers of this lovely car felt it was too much trouble to hit the button to unlock the doors when ready to get out of the car. The only thought of your safety when moving the car not when you stop it. This car was purchased for my elderly mother whom I now amy worried about going anywhere alone because of this new feature that puts her at risk. My 06 does not have this safety risk and when dealer tried to disconect it they could only stop it from locking not stop it from unlocking.

<TEXT>Own an elantra which I just gave to my son after 4 years with no problems, so I thought I'd try the larger Sonata. Just turn 2000 miles. Compared my car to co-worker's CTS and BMW 325. The sonata fell a little short on handling but for big bucks less, it was the winner. Very smooth ride and pleasing power...no problem moving in and out of traffic. A six-speed transmission would be smoother but the 5-speed is not jerky and the shift timing is good. Car is not for a sports driver in terms of cornering at higher speeds, but the handling is more like a luxury car, which is fine. I have enjoyed it so far with no regrets. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it last month ... put 1500 miles on it with two out of state trips + local driving. MPG=20/30 ... I traded up from a 2000 Elanta ... the bored out 2.0 engine is needed for this car because its 550lbs more than the Elantra. That's only .1L more on each cylinder to give it 2.4L. It works as a wanabe 6cyl. I like the car even though it rides a bit stiff and takes the bumps & cracks a bit rough ... accentuates the pot holes ... OUCH!... needs a bit softer suspension ... I had the Michaelin tires on the Elantra also ... they stunk & wore out in less than a year ... maybe changing them would also help the ride! Would have been nice if they threw in some rear splash shields. Great Deal !</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Liked the layout of the dash .. You actually see the clock, all the time, instead of looking through a steering wheel. The steering wheel controls are good also, after getting used to them. The 5-speed tranny is great to hold your speed when you throw it to the right & shift it. I like the control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a 2009 SE V6. Spent a lot of time narrowing the search. Came down to the Honda Accord. Then just for curiosity, stopped @ a Hyundai dealerships and drove the Sonata. Quieter, more creature comforts for less $$, and a warranty that's best on the market. So far have only 500 miles. The first fill up, got 31 mpg. The car really is amazing how smooth and responsive. You're at 80 mph and unless you're paying attention, you wouldn't know it. The SE really is a great handling car for a family sedan. My other driver is a Mustang GT. The Sonata isn't a GT, but it's almost as tight in the corners Give the Sonata a fair shot. You'll be amazed.</TEXT>

We also recommend the steering wheel audio controls & the power seat. Ours also has the light control group. This is an Outstanding Automobile. There is no nicer car for the money.

<TEXT>at first, but I wanted the lux features without the cost and the research convinced me to buy the Sonata. I got the 4 cyl limited with Navi and BT and it really has blown me away. All of the positive things people have written about the velvety ride (but not too soft), power for a 4 cyl, and great gas mileage are dead on. Interior is very sharp and placement of controls is generally very good. The interior is spacious and seats are comfortable for a big person (6'1" - 220 lbs). More than anything, it's the little things that have impressed me; the air cylinders that open the trunk and hood, the dual layer SW controls and door lock prevention when keys are in the ignition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Voice recognition Navi system with stereo and IPod integration (need the $30 Hyundai cable) is excellent. The trip computer, especially the mpg display really helps you focus on gas mileage. The auto dimming mirror with built in homelink is great and doesn't move when buttons are pressed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just picked up my new Sonata GLS in slate blue yesterday, and will admit that I bought it to save money, having traded down from a G35 with 95k miles. I looked at compact cars and quickly discovered they were too small. Then looked at the Accord Camry and Sonata. Found the Accord in cloth uncomfortable and in leather too pricey. The Camry was an excellent ride and very comfortable and decided to shop Sonata against it. I found the Sonata with virtually the same ride, a bit less comfortable with a high level of content and great layout and space. The clincher was the price - a full 5 grand less than Camry. Thought I might have 2nd day remorse, but enjoyed cruising with AC and the XM today.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system with XM radio is fabulous. I don't know how they do it but it sounds better than my G35 with a BOSE 220 watt. Very nice dash layout. Spacious interior and trunk. Good AC.

I literally went 10 days in 3/4 of a tank of gas. That totaled about 375 miles. The tank is 16.9 gallons and dare I say one would get 500 miles on a single tank during highway driving. The Sonata is the first Hyundai I've owned since I bought a Scoupe in 1993 in Southern California. That car had the best paint job I've ever had in a car. I love the XM Radio in the Sonata.

I rented a Sonata a few months ago on vacation which got me interested in the car in the first place, but don't remember this hard ride as an issue.

The interior is very well appointed,I recommend the upgrade to power driver's seat and the sunroof!The wheel mounted audio controls are a must! Very nice to drive and handles like a much heavier car, not much road bump transmission!! The exterior is a bit plain,but still nice. I would say that for the money you can't beat this car.

<TEXT>My 97 Lexus ES 300 was beginning to age and needed repairs. I decided instead to purchase a new vehicle. After a ton of searching, I settled on a 2009 Sonata. I've put over 500 miles on it and have loved every second of it. After comparing it to the Accord, Camry, and Malibu, I chose the Sonata because I liked it better, regardless of price (even though price was lower). The cabin is very nice and I do not feel as though I've downgraded from my previous Lexus. My initial estimates have me getting around 29mpg with about 50/50 city/hwy driving. Although some people seem to take issue with the steering/handling of the Sonata, I love it. I drive soft and easy, so the car matches my driving well</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am flabbergasted at the smoothness and agility of the Sonata 4 cyl. It surpasses anything I ever expected. I have been driving a 3.8 V-6 with every conceivable option. This Sonata beats the pants off my old car even though I liked it a lot. Mileage is in the low 30's, pick up is surprisingly quick and quiet. The ride is great, albeit not quite as good as my XG350. It handles very well with a good feel on the road and in traffic. It has enough options to be comfortable and complete. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>quiet engine, spunky response, cool lighting on dash at night. Could use a tad better radio and sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched and drove other cars for 3 months. My short list also included the Fusion, Camry and Accord. I kept going back to this one because I got everything I was looking for without having to buy a package (or not be able to get it at all) not to mention the warranty. The Camry had shifting issues, the Fusion didn't have stability control, the Accord dashboard was ugly and confusing. I only have 1000 miles on it, but so far it's been an amazing car. I'm getting 21-22 mpg avg city and hwy combined. I got the SE auto - had a Taurus and the v6 best fit what I was used to driving. It has more than enough power for me. It handles well, shifts so smoothly and looks great too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, dashboard controls, colors, handling - a little 'looser' than the Taurus but I got used to it quickly, power of the v6, telescoping wheel, steering wheel controls for the radio, roomy back seat and lots of headroom in front, all the storage nooks and crannies in front.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 6.3" 300 lbs guy with a normal driving style. Here is my first impression from my first 200 miles: The good: - great value ( can't beat 14,975$ price) - good interior ( dual color comes with cherry read color) - solid build quality - good fuel economy (200 miles on less than 1/2 tank) - manual tranny is Ok, except the clutch bites too soon The bad: - very soft suspension and numb steering feel - seat is too soft, no adjustable lumbar support or telescope steering wheel for GLS trim The Ugly: - SE trim would probably address most of my complaints but Hyundai simply doesn't manufacture SE I-4 despite the fact it is listed even in their brochure. I would gladly pay 2000$ for SE.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a Santa Fe so i knew the quality that Hyundai offers for the money. The Sonata is an exceptional value compared to the Accord and Camry costing 6-7K more. The fit and finish rival that of Lexus. Despite reviews to the contrary, the car is actually fun to drive and quite peppy even with the 4cyl. The night display is phenomenal with the blue and white lights. The surprise bonus - high gas mileage. I actually got more than 35 miles per gallon on the highway but going little over 60 and keeping a steady foot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 1991 Camry (203K miles) and compared Sonata 4 cyl with add on package vs 2008 Accord and 2009 Camry, to see why I should pay $2000-2800 more for a Camry or Honda. The Accord was not as quiet as the Sonata at 35- 45mph especially, had a slight blind spot in mirror, did not include alarm, had less trunk space, lacked split rear fold back seats (single), but did have superior steering. Camry did not have standard ESC, the clock was in a strange location on dash (look up!), and the body lines on car were bland. At 1900 miles, the Sonata drives well and very quiet, has enough pick up, mileage at 31-32 (mix highway/local), love the XM radio and ipod dock,great trunk /rear seat space </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned used cars since I turned 16 (I'm only 21) but 2 weeks ago I bought my first, brand-spanking new car, the 2009 Sonata. This car is a dream come true. I love the smooth ride, great interior(love the USB hook-up, cd player, and built in XM), nice exterior, and the huge trunk space. I researched cars before buying and came SOOO close to buying a used Honda Accord but I traveled down the road and came upon the Hyuandai car dealership and found my car. I recommend this car to everyone. Even my boyfriend inquired about one (and he has a 2008 Ford Focus!) Lovely car--go get one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Out of the blue decided to trade in my aging 1995 BMW 525i for the Sonata. While the '08 models sharp exterior styling initially caught my eye, the only 4 cylinder models in stock were '09s. The spacious updated interior truly feels classy and the 'fake' manual mode let's you play a little. Acceleration is lacking and gear changes clunky, yet justified by your last refueling receipt. Great gauges and wood trim throughout. Upholstery is bland but practical. Although innovative, integrated USB/AUX ports suffer from compatibility issues (ie. iPhone support). Overall, best value for the money, if you can live with a goofy 'H' on your grill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car after considering the 08 for several months. Also considered Accord, Altima and Mazda6. With or without considering the bargain price, this was the car to beat. It's miles above the 08 Sonata. Everyone I've showed it to loves it, it's been mistaken for a Lexus more than once. The ride is absolutely smooth, and acceleration remarkably quick even though I haven't really stomped on the gas yet (not quite through break-in). Mileage is slightly better than the EPA estimates, I've been getting over 30 highway and near 20 city. Shifting was a bit rough at first but it seems to be getting better. Interior quality is outstanding and the controls are intuitive and well placed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first car in 10 years. I drove a Grand Cherokee Lorado. Since I drive 90 plus miles round trip to work a day, my husband and I decided with gas pricing soaring we need a vehicle with better gas mileage, but for a low price with high performance and the Hyundai Sonata meets all our needs. I had my mind made on Powder White Pearl with Coco(charcoal gray) interior and a 4 cyl. however this was a color combination that was next to impossible to find. I decided to go with Medium silver blue with gray leather interior. I love it. We have put 1299 miles on our Sonata since May 31, 2008. No problems so far. I enjoy driving it.</TEXT>

It's loaded with options, has the 60/40 split rear seat, drives & rides like a dream for 1/2 the price of the CTS! It's a beautiful car. Got the camel/pearl.

<TEXT>I had shortlisted the Mercedes C300 Sport, Acura TSX 09 and Infiniti G35 for my new car purchase. I never ever thought of going for a Hyundai. I just wanted to test-drive a Sonata and I was quite pleasantly surprised with the ride quality, interiors etc. I paid close to 18,900 for my 09 Sonata and after taxes etc, it was still 12K cheaper than TSX 09 after tax. For my day-to-day office commute and occasional long drive, this car was ideal. In the extra money I saved, I could make my house more comfortable, than showing off with a piece of machinery I use maybe an hour every day. The rated mileage is 21/31 city/highway. But I got 35 mpg on highway on my recent trip and get 25 mpg in city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honestly, I just bought the car for an UNBELIEVABLE price. My out the door price was almost $2000 UNDER invoice! This included tax, tags, title....everything! I wanted to get an '08 4-cyl. because of the $3000 rebate they were offering, but no one had any left, so I "settled" for an '09 for a few hundred dollars more. I'm really glad I did. I love the new interior compared to the '08's, and the extra horsepower and better fuel economy are just added bonuses. I'm used to the old days of smaller cars with better fuel mileage, but the Sonata doesn't do bad for a mid-size car. If it's anywhere near as reliable as C******** R****** says it is, we should be enjoying this car for many years.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of room! Very quiet ride. I have to be very careful because I'm used to smaller cars, and I feel like I'm driving so slow. The Shiftronic transmission, even though I've hardly used it.

I did not purchase because of the great price only; it has a lot of standard equipment and quality. Many talk about trade in value, I say remember Honda and Toyota not many wanted one of them in the beginning. You have to give up the ghost and admit this car is awesome to own, drive and be seen in. I have black with black leather and when I am driving I believe it feels like it cost me over 30 grand. Now the good news; averaging 33.8 mpg on the highway and loving it.

The seats are more comfortable, the controls are almost perfect. The engine and powertrain are great with a 5 speed auto matched to a PZEV 2.4L. This is certainly not the most sporty car, but it has plenty of power for a 4 banger. Highly recommended over almost any other mid or compact sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was going to buy an Accord or Camry when I decided to also test drive the 08' Sonata SE. As soon as I got it in, I knew it had something special.I couldn't find an 08' when I was ready to purchase it so I decided to get the 09' Limited V6 instead in Willow Gray(nice color!). It offers an excellent, comfortable, & quiet ride. 30 days and 1,015 miles later here's the scoop: Mileage is about 17-18 mpg/local and I'm averaging 23-25/hwy.(Not bad considering it's a 249 Horsepower/6 Cylinder). The ride is very smooth and responsive. The bottom line is this: Don't worry about its resale value, save your $, and go with it. At least test drive and consider it vs. its peers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, just got this car home today! It's the V6 Limited model with navigation, which was the only option. The Limited model is fully loaded with just about every feature you could want. There was a $1,000 rebate on the car which was icing on the cake, because it's already under priced in my opinion for what Hyundai is giving you. I haven't owned the car long enough to discuss reliability, but Hyundai has come a long way in the past 25 years and I'm sure it will last me a long time with regular maintenance. What an amazing vehicle! Perfect interior ergonomics, extremely quiet even at 80 MPH, very fuel efficient for a V6, and very fun to drive! The 2009 Sonata refresh is a home run! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although the newly released 2009 Sonata offers a new navigational system with nice features, it may have been released prematurely. Typically I drive approximately 42,000 miles annually along the east coast. I rely heavily on construction and accident location information. The navigation system offers a detour selection allowing you to plan a detour at various distances. After several days with no answers from the dealership or Hyundai Corporation, and many hours on the phone doing refreshes to the XM NAVTraffic downloads, the answer that finally arrived was that Hyundai did not release the NAVTraffic capability in the 2009 model. Release is expected sometime next year. What a bummer! </TEXT>

I looked at the Honda Fit, Pontiac Vibe, Toyota Matrix, Mazda 3, etc. I wanted a small car that would carry cargo. So why would I end up with a sedan. I bought the Sonata because it was a great car and a great value. It also gets great mileage (38 mpg on the Interstate at 60 mph). I wanted the four-cylinder to get better mileage. What I didn?t expect was great performance. I also didn?t expect to have a luxury car with almost all the options I could think of for such a low price.

The only music that played was some MP3 songs no Itunes. I went to my local dealer who couldn't resole the issue I contacted Hyundai directly and the response I got was to go to another dealer to have them look at it, even though that dealer is over 50 miles away. So still no answer to why the IPOD port doesn't work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just took delivery and am pleased thus far. The interior upgrades (esp. The dash) are vastly improved. Getting about 29 mpg so far. I personally wouldn't spend the monies on the v6 as the upgraded motor has plenty and the throttle response is 'right there' when giving it gas. Also why we bought is the increased seat width and more spacious cabin. We were looking at a 06-07 Nissan altima, but found the 4 cylinder to be noisy when shifting through gears. Plus the altima is priced 5-6k more. The fit and finish is tight and the ride is very quiet and smooth! Only thing missing is the tight steering response. I'll write more when I can get it away from my wife and finally drive it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Never pictured myself in a Hyundai (I own 2 hondas), but on-line research suggested a test drive was in order. I tried the sonata in '08 and '09 4 and 6 cylinder limited editions.

I planned to buy a 4 cylinder for mileage, but fell in love with the power of the new 6 cylinder. Lots of Nice features, and first rate build quality. The limited is a lot of car for the price of a stripped down model elsewhere!

<TEXT>DRIVING: The most obvious difference in the 2009 is the tighter suspension system, which can take off-ramps at 50-60 mph without feeling like the car is going to roll. I also own a Mercedes-Benz and can say that this Hyundai's suspension is remarkably comparable (never thought I would say that). Also, the transmission shifts much smoother than the earlier edition. There's also a more robust engine which delivers oomph when you touch the pedal. Cabin noise has been reduced substantially, as compared with earlier. INTERIOR: They finally got the interior right! It looks like, and may very well be, a high end car now! Color combination in the Camel interior is beautiful. Dash is remarkable!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hyundai has finally upgraded the dash board to a modern foreign car look with high-quality materials and well-though out ergonomics. The dash lighting is a spaceship blue which looks very cool. Stereo is simply awesome! Stereo comes complete with XM satellite radio, MP3/USB input, 6 disc changer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The redesign is a lot more fluid and curvy than last years box. I test drove last year's 08 sonata and it only had ok power. The upgrade on the new four-cylinder feels like there is more power off the line and highway passing. If I lived in hilly terrain, I would purchase the v6 but when I climb hills, I use the shiftronic and it goes just fine. Exterior is beautiful and Pearl White is stunning. Could go without steel wheels, but the covers have a Nice design. Interior is very Nice with high quality cloths and plastics. Good stereo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the vehicle for 9 months & 16,000 mi. and it is still a great car! No problems, great ride & handling, good performance from the 4 cyl. engine and on highway trips over 37 mpg! Love all the standard features and a warranty that shames Toyota & Honda and many more. If all the vehicles in its class cost the same I'd still pick the Sonata. What a bonus that its thousands less!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd review and I now have over 12,000 miles on my Sonata. I recently averaged 31.6 mpg on a family trip at speeds between 75 & 80 mph, which seems to validate the "broken-in engine gets better gas mileage" statement. My ONLY gripe thus far is the low tire pressure warning light that comes on intermediately in error. Not the end of the world, but annoying when you find yourself pulling over to check your tire inflation for no reason. Otherwise, for above-average "basic" transportation, this car is hard to beat. I'd even recommend this car to my enemies.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Buying this vehicle loaded gives you most every creature comfort the average driver could want. You just don't get to have a "premium" label on your grill. The ride performance and comfort is top notch, easily matching the Camry or Accord but at a reasonable price. The warranty is great but the quality probably means you won't need the benefits of the warranty; though the security is nice to have. Until recently Hyundai were looked at much the way early Toyotas and Hondas were seen. It took time to realize that these cars were of high quality. For a "family sedan" you can't beat the package you get. Love my nav system, bluetooth, leather, powre and heated seats, remote start...</TEXT>

Never had this much trouble. It stalls going out of my driveway, in intersections and I feel like I have to rev it to keep it going. Even stalls in 2nd gear around corners. Something is not right.

<TEXT>Purchased Limited w/nav in Jan 09, traded in 2002 Honda EX and paid 16K, best deal for 4-door sedan bar none. Incredible list of features for the money, and after 5500 miles, I feel this car is superior to Honda. Happy with engine performance, seat comfort, sound system. But considerable body roll and suspension noise on bad pavement, as many people have noted. Gas mileage not as good as advertised, only getting 18mpg in city. Mileage computer only tracks mileage since last fill-up, no lifetime stats. Controls on driver's door not lit, hard to find at night. Limited options for viewing and playing music on USB drive. Trunk is hard to close when holding something, you really have to push down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Despite the shortcomings, this is still a great deal. Happy with the interior design, sound system with many inputs, auto lights and climate control. Adequate power and smooth highway ride. This car is several inches shorter than Japanese competitors and easy to park. Good AC and heating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased yesterday so I'm sure that I am a little biased right now but I am really impressed with the quality. To give some perspective my old car was a 2007 Taurus so this is an upgrade. The doors are solid, the ride is quiet and very comfortable and I think it handles great. I read many reviews on how blah it is but I think it is pretty responsive. The 6 cyl engine is more than I really need but the drop in fuel economy wasn't that great. The interior is excellent. High quality materials and everything seems to be in the right place. After the $3K rebate I felt it was a lot of car compared the competition. I didn't think about Hyundai at first but I'm glad I gave it a chance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove and looked at the Altima and Camry before deciding on the Sonata (I have owned Hondas for years and wanted something different). Seemed to me that the other brands are resting on their name and are letting quality and value slip. Hyundai really seems to be trying and has put some very nice features into their base model that you have to pay a lot more for in the other brands. I only have about 400 miles so far but I am impressed with the car. Quality seems great. If the car can make it to 200K with no major repairs I will say they have arrived. Can't beat a price that is $4K to $6K less than the others and a 5yr/60K bumper to bumper with 100K powertrain warranty. I'm impressed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have this car for 1 year and this is my first review. Very smooth and brisk 4 cyl. Powertrain. Like the shiftronic feature. Interior is beautiful and comfortable. Controls feel like quality and work flawlessly. Body design is classy in my opinion. Highway mpg exceeds epa, can average 34, mixed driving is around 22. In all fairness I do lots of driving in an area with poorly timed lights, lots of heavy traffic and idling - that alone yields an mpg of 14! Hence the 8 rating. Minor misalignment of few body panels. Creaking from interior parts and yes, the distracting suspension noise that doesn't mar a smooth ride too badly. Still, lot of car at a great deal. Pleasant ride. Couldn't do better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After much research, this is by far the best car in it's class for value, quality, warranty, and standard features. The ride is excellent, tight road hugging suspension and great handling. The 2.4L engine is surprisingly strong and much easier on gas than the V6. Interior is quiet, very pleasing to the eye. All electronics are well placed and easy to see. Leather seats are very comfortable. Exterior has great lines with chrome accents and the cocoa metallic finish is beautiful in the sunlight. The 17" wheels and low profile tires are a great accent. Trunk space is huge and rear seats fold down with access to the trunk. Nice headroom in rear. Great savings with CARS and rebates</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased after reviewing and test driving the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. My impressions: Solid well built car, great amenities, nice ride. Before buying I read the reviews about the car being a rattle-trap on bumpy roads, well my driveway is about 150 yards of dirt washboard and the car didn't rattle excessively while traversing it. Yes with the very tight suspension you can feel the road irregularities, the car however never feels out of control. And it really feels and sounds solid. My other car is a Merc-Benz S420 and the sounds in the driveway are comparable. I would recommend this car to anyone needing reliable basic transportation at a value price.

<TEXT>I have now owned this vehicle for 1 year with 20k and it hasn't had so much as a hiccup. What originally sold me, apart from the price and warranty was the interior and trunk size, (large), and the level of comfort, usually only felt with leather upgraded interior. I love all the thoughtful little upgrades which are standard, such as the 3 nozzle window sprayer, the above visor lit vanities lights, and beautiful interior stack. I have been averaging 31 mpg on regular, and honestly, I hardly miss my G35(only off the ramps and when I feel a little crazy), or its 20 mpg with super. My wife now likes to take it whenever she can and everyone who rides with me is quite impressed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 48. After many years of sports cars and pick-ups, including my last Chevy S-10,which literally fell apart at 70,000 miles, I bought a new Sonata. I am a family man, with daughters 11 and 8. My wife drives a van. So, I decided to be practical -- buy a family sedan with good ratings and few frills. It came down to a Sonata or Honda Accord. I liked the Sonata better after test drives (the base Accord had a weird dash with giant radio call numbers) -- and it was $3,600 less. So far I like it, though there may be a 'thump' underneath. I liked the S-10 new too for a while, but quickly problems arose and I was profoundly disappointed overall. No more union- made cars for me.</TEXT>

The greatest two things are : (i) size: even with he front seat entirely back the people in the back have ample space; (ii) the engine: the "little" 2.4 is a real joy: because of the manual upshift, you can really beat most of the other traffic. In town, the car gets 20 mpg. But highway, I easily get better than 35 mpg. The fifth gear picks up very well and moves smoothly from low rpm to high rpm. I just did 1500 miles in three days and the seats give ample support as well. What a car. Why can't GM make such gems? Ed </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have been driving the Sonata for a few months now, including two 600 mile plus trips. Comfortable ride, great gas mileage (26 around town, 34 on highway), and easy to drive. Especially like the addition of the USB port for IPODS or IPHONES, it works very well. Only downside is the noise the engine makes at idle. It has a ticking sound, which goes away once you get the car past idle. This sound is not heard inside car unless door or windows are open. The 5 speed automatic transmission makes up for any lack of power that the 4 cyl engine has. Overall, I have been very impressed, would buy the same car again, and recommend it for others.</TEXT>

Great looking, lots of pep, good stereo, good mileage. Hyundai has realy dropped the ball with the suspension. The car rides OK over very flat roads, on any uneven surfaces, THE CAR THUNDERS LIKE IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY SPRINGS OR SHOCKS... It was substantially louder than my 2005..

<TEXT>Very good value when compared to Nissan and Toyota, with/without the rebate, and excellent value vs. Accord with Hyundai rebate. The 2.4 has good power, but performance of the 5 speed automatic leaves a bit to be desired. Hyundai engineers failed in "coordinating" the transmission gearing and/or final drive and/or cruise control sensor. Climbing any incline over a couple of degrees at 60 mph or so will surely result in downshift from 5th to 4th (an increase of 900 rpm) when some downshifting is not at all necessary, or only a 5th gear "shift" to clutch/slippage (an increase of only 300-400 rpm) in 5th gear would be sufficient -- though still 'busy'. Otherwise, I'm glad to own one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car until I would shift gears on the interstate (5 speed manual)and the clutch would just lay on the floor- flat! I loved everything else about the car so I traded it for a 2009 Sonata automatic. No problems now with the car. Of course, I took a beating on my trade-in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic that also has a manual type shifter.Interior quality and warranty are outstanding! Great gas mileage. This is truly a great car for the money (just get the automatic!).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Big car size. Comfortable Ride. Appealing Interior. Decent 4 cyclinder performance. Attractive Dash. Huge trunk. No matter how I worked the numbers I could not justify a Malibu, Accord, or Camry. At least it is assembled in America with 50% U.S. parts. Yes depreciation is tougher, but 60,000 bumper to bumper warranty and $3000 less all up front more than makes up for it since I drive cars to over 100,000. </TEXT>

<TEXT>While car shopping came across a 2008 Sonata and after a test drive, I was so impressed, I purchased a new 2009 Sonata. My research was very positive and all sources spoke on the great value and quality of this vehicle. I currently have 7500 km (4500 mi) on my Sonata. The vehicle has performed extremely well without one problem, not even any new car adjustments. I found the dealer, Steele Hyundai to be top notch! I had a Volvo S40 Major disappointment!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There are so many. I love the style of the trunk which offers an unobstructed opening, no intrusions front hinges. Quality which is noted everywhere in the vehicle, leather steering wheel, great dash, storage features ride, gas economy....it goes on and on! Heat </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car belongs to my wife, but because it was new, the 2009 Sonata, GLS, 2.4L pezev, 5 Spd auto. This car replaced a 2006 Sonata. It had been a good car but this new car is an excellent ride and many may not believe the gas mileage we obtained. I drove all but 200 miles of our 6000mi trip. I filled each tank and checked the mileage for the entire trip. The total avg MPG was 30.9. Lowest tank MPG was 27.8 the highest MPG was 34.5. Given just a little care on the acceleration...One can easily get 500 Miles out of a full tank of gas. I recorded several in the hi 400's and one at 497mi another at 488. Ride quality is much improved over the '06. We are a two Hyundai car family love'm both... </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The mileage obtainable on a tank of gas! Second, would be the ride quality very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Doubts about buying but test drive awesome. Handles very well, extremely tight on curves and hills. Only drawback too much road noise, but overall one of best cars I've owned. Interior arrangement of dials and controls very easy to learn and operate. Big Surprise - gets advertised 30mpg!!! And 4 cylinder with 5 speed auto - cannot tell difference from small v-6, especially on hills.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased 5/09. Initial impression: nice looking and fuel mileage is good for a car this size. After driving for 1 week, my impression as follows: The engine runs smooth however the 5 speed automatic transmission hangs in 5th gear overdrive at 40 mph and engine lugs. Suspension: you hear TERRIBLE road noise inside car and can FEEL any and all road imperfections in steering wheel. It's scary! Loud rattling in trunk area when riding down bumpy roads. Have had car to the dealer 2 x's for this with no satisfaction. Hyundai needs fix this Sonata model as they have done with past Sonata's and issue a recall to install proper struts/mounts. Hard rubber Michelin Tires may be part of the problem</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Sonata in Sept. 2008, so it has been over 9 months now and I am still loving my car. I love the redesigned interior. It feels luxurious and elegant and not at all cheap. All the buttons are in easy reach, and the dash emits a nice blue glow at night. I have had lots of compliments on the smooth ride and comfortable seats. The trunk is spacious. The ride is smooth and handles very well. I got so much car for the price (leather, heated seats, sunroof, XM). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design, I wish the exterior didn't look so much like the previous years' models. Cocoa Metallic is a beautiful metallic brown, Infinity sound system is top notch. I get great mileage on the highway. I like how my warranty will last longer than the car payments.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since I drive a great deal I get another car every three years on high mile lease programs. I have leased, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, All GM, FOrd, Chrysler vehicle's. For at least 50,000 miles of hard driving in all conditions over the past 27 years. I personally will get ONLY hyundai's for the rest of my life unless the company changes a lot. Value in supreme, comfort is great, handling in snow is great, visibility is great. Very Solid car. Until a co-worker got me to look at the Hyundai It was never considered. I have had a Sonata SE V6 since 1/15/09. My wife even replaced our Lexus RX 350 with a Veracruze by Hyundai</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 20 years old and my stepdad bought me a 2009 Hyundai Sonata, my mom has a 2008 Toyota Camry and my 19 year old brother has a 2008 Honda Accord sedan, It cant get any better, we compare our cars on a daily basis both their vehicles were 20,600 for the Accord and 21+ for the v6 Camry. My sonata was 17,000 dollars and with the GLS i get many more features like the standard Ipod jack, Bluetooth connectivity, XM radio, MPG gauge,( Camry has none of that) and semi auto ( accord doesnt have it) I love the fact that i got a car just as good if not better for 3,000+ dollars less with the best warranty </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Limited today with an MSRP of $25K and invoice of $23K for $20K with the $3K rebate. With $5K for my trade I financed about $17K. Beautiful in camel pearl. Comfortable leather seats. Lots of headroom even with the sunroof. Beige seats with black carpet & dash is really something different. Great sound system. Comfortable ride. Very pleased.

<TEXT>I like most everything about my new Sonata, but I didn't really get the color I wanted. I preferred the Natural Khaki, a beautiful light green, or the Dark Cherry. However, these colors, for some reason, were only available with the light beige cloth, which looked like it would get dirty very easy, and which illuminated the interior. So I had to take an exterior color that looks pretty boring grey, to get the darker [grey] interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been a great car for my family. We have had to replace the radio twice already. It had several electronic glitches.

<TEXT>Bought it after reading a lot of reviews and test drives on Memorial weekend. I knew that many people are complaining about suspension noise and cracking noise from dashboard due to temperature fluctuation. But the price was unbeatable, I have option package 2 and I paid almost 6K less than Accord LX. I put only a few hundred miles, so far I no problems other than cracking noise coming from the dashboard when I turn on A/C. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PRICE...... I like exterior and interior design. Trunk is bigger than Accord's and Camry's. Mileage is great so far, around 29 mpg. XM radio, USB and iPOD interface.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Driven It A Year Now</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Had this car just under a year and approaching 10,000 on the odometer. Couldn't be happier with the car: I average slightly over 30 mpg on the highway, it's quiet as a cemetery and I haven't experienced any of the minor gripes that I've seen other owners contend with. Recent road trips of 500+ round trip miles didn't fatigue me at all. And call it luck or diligence, but I don't have a single ding on any part of the body. This is the first vehicle that I've owned that I take to a hand car wash, and it looks as good as the day I drove it off the dealer's lot. Wouldn't hesitate to get another Sonata, but I'm going to wait til any kinks are worked out of the Genesis and get a 2012+ model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Taking a risk and buying a Hyundai after 11 years of ownership of a Nissan Maxima. There have been many doubts but so far this Hyundai keeps dispelling them. Unlike any other car I've owned this one has prompted me to drive out of the way just for the sheer enjoyment of driving and listening to the amazing stock stereo system. For a mid sized car it comes awfully close to Cadillac in ride quality. If you need to save precious $$$ from a new Camry or Accord I suggest you take gander at this car before making a decision. Hyundai has a chip on its shoulder and it shows as their newer products may not be just closing the gap but jumping ahead instead.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>For a stock 80 watt stereo this thing rocks especially with XM/USB features and crisp clear sound. Also I really like the 249 HP engine with shiftronic tranny for fun driving. Finally I'd say the large storage spaces throughout including the huge trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> OK, I only have the Sonata a couple of weeks but I am very very happy with the car. The power is impressive for a four cylinder and the gas mileage is great, avg 29 MPG all around. That avg is highway and city combined. It has a classy interior that is well layed out and very comfortable. I bought the Sonata to replace an Elantra, 77K miles, that I gave to my son. He needed a car. This is my seventh Hyundai. I traded a Land Rover for a Santa Fe, which I still own. I made a great trade. To date I've had no issues with any of my Hyundai. I plan to look at the new Genesis Coupe when it hits the showroom floor. I got the Sonata at an I can't pass it up deal, $12400 for the GLS automatic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the Ipod hook-up and the USB input. The paint job is classy and is very eye catching. The interior is well done and looks great. I've had numerous compliments on the color I chose, Blue flake. The seats are comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched a new midsize sedan for about 10 months, and kept coming back to the Sonata. It hurt me not to buy American, but this car just had everything I wanted - for a price no one could compete with. After (only) two and half months, it's been exactly as advertised: Very nice interior; very good fuel economy (32 highway); handles well, and equally (if not more)important, impressed my snooty Infinity/BMW/Acura desiring wife!! Oh, and a note to those who complain about the doors automatically unlocking when you put the car in park... The owners manual says, in BOLD "This feature can be adjusted by your authorized Hyundai dealer". Read the manual!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything about the interior. It's very tight; very quiet; very nice looking, very roomy and very practical. It handles like a small car yet gives you the room of a larger sedan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let me start by saying that I think any new car review by owner needs to be prefaced with "What car were you driving before you bought this ?" Everyone has their own standards by which the judge a car. It would be helpful to know where the owner is "coming from". In my case, I was driving a 97 4Cyl Camry with 101K miles. I have owned the Sonata for 3 months now, and so far I am really pleased with all aspects of it. Initially I felt that the steering was a little bit of a slave to the road, pulling either way depending on which side of the crown I was on. But that has worked itself out after the first month. This is a great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior.... the whole interior is great. I challenge anyone to find a car in this price range that has an interior that can compete with the 2009 Sonata. Everything is laid out beautifully, chrome in all the right place. The dash looks even better at night, a very pleasing display</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like most everything about our new Sonata. The (PE) Popular Equipment package, for about $600 extra, makes the GLS pretty nice, w/pwr seats, woodrgrain interior trim, radio controls on the steering wheel, trip computer. Somehow the advertised price of $14k went up to $21k by the time I got out the door (service contract, taxes, extras like floor mats) even tho I qualified for the $3500 rebates. </TEXT>

Electronic Stability Control comes standard on all models, and one can turn it on and off. ESB only comes available on higher level Camrys and it is always on. I can go about 450 miles on one tank of gas. Overall, for the money, I couldn't be happier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle to get out of my 2004 Chevy Impala with 13800 miles and a tranny that was slipping. the color is the first thing i noticed as it has a pop to it that looks different. for a base model i was impressed with the features. leaving a V6 for a V4 was hard but my pockets is happy as the gas mileage is 25-28 on the city streets and 29-31 on the highway. speaking of the city streets, Chicago is the worst with pot holes everywhere including the highway. this car moves great to avoid them and when i do have to go over some it doesn't feel too bad. i compare this to my wife's altima and i love it. she actually wants to take the sonata over the altima. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a '02 Elantra for a '09 Sonata. Nice step up. Got a great deal on the Sonata. It has every thing I wanted in a car. 4 cylinder performance is adequate. Of course more power would be nice but why sacrifice the fuel economy? I rented or test drove nearly all the competition and found the Sonata, all things considered, to be as good as any of them. When I factored in the price and warantee, the Sonata comes out ahead of the competition.</TEXT>

Unlike other entry level mid-size sedans, the interior of the 09 Sonata does not feel cheap. The fuel economy of the 5speed is fantastic. The car handles well, and has plenty of room in the interior for passengers. The trunk space is bigger than my first apartment. This is a great car, fun to drive, and a great price. (I got the 2009 GLS 5 speed brand new for $14,500 in Richmond, VA).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a car enthusiast and love cars. I can't afford BMW's or Mercedes so I have to buy what I can afford. This is our 2nd Hyundai (have a 2007 Santa Fe limited). I paid $13,500 out of the door. You can not buy a new car for this money. Now to the car, great redesigned interior, VERY smooth 4cyl 175hsp engine with a VERY smooth suspension and soft clutch, very quiet ride, no more or less than a Honda Accord (which I also have). There's plenty of room, very comfortable seats, nicely designed dash and center console and beautiful exterior and paint selections. I only wish that the GLS came with the sunroof option and the dual exhaust or that the SE model came in a 5speed transmission. I love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall it's a very nice car. The interior feel is very upscale. My wife is not thrilled with backseat storage and there are only 4 cupholders, 2 in the back seat arm rest, but other than that it is a very nice car. Only 1100 miles so far. The mileage is a little lower than stated, but I do a lot of short hop type of driving, so I can understand that. Also, weather has been cold/chilly which also affects it and I probably haven't gotten past the break-in period. Other than that, I love it. XM 3 month trial is very nice. The sound system and radio are awesome. You have to buy a $30 cable for the IPOD to work correctly, but it's awesome. Ride could be a little smoother, but overall is good.</TEXT>
