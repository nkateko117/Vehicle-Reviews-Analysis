Just turned 90K and still pleased. 2nd set of tires 3 weeks ago. If purchasing tires, buy same speed rating as original. 90% interstate driving is returning 32-34 MPG. Oil change by Maintenance Minder averaging 10K intervals. No issues and will probably drive to 200K. Brake pads front and rear once to date.

I've owned three vehicles prior to my 08' Accord. My first love was a Malibu, my second was Olds Alero and finally my Isuzu Ascender. I enjoyed every vehicle but, I had problems with all of the in the first year. I have to say that my Honda by far has been the most reliable. It's quiet, get good gas mileage and looks clean inside and out. I love the new body style and the interior is a simple pleasure except for the center dash. Overall I have had minimal issues and the car performs like a champ. I believe it's in the top four cars for the price range. I don't think I could have made a wiser choice in a vehicle for a single guy or family vehicle for that matter. Best vehicle for the price!

Purchased a Honda Accord V6 due to the reviews. This car has been the worst new car I have ever bought. Been to the shop 3 times for the coil replacement, 1 time for a new injector pump, 5 times for door and dash rattles and brakes at 26000 miles. No more Hondas for me. The dealer has been great to me but the car has been a poor choice!

I leased a 2008 Accord in April 2008 - at 7,000 miles I noticed that the heater was not working - took it to the dealership - they determined that a rock had hit & put a hole in the radiator - not covered by warranty - $900 out of my pocket. 4,000 miles later the temp gauge went sky high - immediately took to dealership (less than 10 miles) and was informed that I now have a blown head gasket due to the radiator issue -$1600 out of my pocket - still discussing the issue but not happy with the radiator design or the run around - no car for 5 days now. No free rental as it is not a warranty item. Check engine light also comes on and goes off intermittently - Do I have a Lemon???

Overall a pretty nice car but has some model consistent issues such as: BAD brake design-very premature wear out (just google it) and overkill on driver seat lumbar even at minimum setting. Also on 4 cyl models flickering head and tail lights whenever a/c compressor engaged. At times (often) automatic shifting is pretty jerky. The brakes and flickering lights are safety issues but to date still no recalls?

Purchased car with only 31 miles. Two weeks later car was having a new steering column replaced. A week later rear of car was vibrating when I drive speeds that exceeded 40 miles per hour. Took car back to dealer. Something had to be repaired in truck area to stop vibration. Two months after this car went back to the shop and found that the steering column had to be replace again? WOW by now ready to give car back. Very disappointed in Honda customer service. I have owned several Honda products but this is by far the worst model I have ever owned. Drivers seat not comfortable, the car itself compared to other models of similar class. I rate this car a 2 on a scale of 10!!!!

Overall a solid car: big, roomy, handles very well and holds a family of four. I brought my 2008 Honda in April 2008 and have not had any issues with the brakes. I checked my rear brakes three months ago and they look OK. Uneven rear brake wear where the inside pad wears prematurely indicates a problem. Regular use of the parking brake should SET the rear inner brake pads. I believe that is the cause for all the brake problems. I had a 1994 Honda accord and the rear pads wear at about 40000 miles and the front at 60000 miles.

Very happy with my 08 Accord, performance is quite adequate it has nice looks and is a great long- distance cruiser.

This is the first Accord I've owned since 1993, and we just sold it. We kept it for slightly under 2 years. The motor was strong for a 4 and with such a large car we averaged over 25 MPG combined driving. Our best tank was 31. The road noise was greater than expected. We had the driver?s seat in for repair twice, one for a frame replacement to fix the "power ratchet" issue. Our last item was the brakes. We only got 28,000 miles from our pads and with the replacement they still were not "great". Not a bad car, but not in league with my 1993 or my Toyota.

I recently bought a 1.5 year old EXL w/Navi. I traded a 2005 Infiniti GSX, and should have done it sooner. I owned an Acura for 8 flawless years and am a Honda fan, but a friend who's a sales manager at a dealership called to say he had a clean '08 accord, and I jumped at it. Bang for the buck it's hard to imagine a better vehicle. It's very comfortable, remarkably large inside and just an overall great vehicle. It is far more refined than the G (granted, the G is an aggressive car) but the fit and finish are much better. The mileage is great, and I've had to get used to stopping less for gas. For you non-Honda people, try one, and try the Accord. It deserves the raves it gets.

This car is full of annoyances. Front seats are very uncomfortable. V6 VCM is a joke, 270HP feel more like 200, fuel economy is terrible and I can feel the car hesitate every time the VCM turns cylinders on/off. "Premium" stereo sounds mediocre at best, the average rental car has a better sounding system. Squeaks and rattles near the rear deck, sunroof, center console, passenger seat. Driver door exterior handle sticks. Constant road noise. No memory seats, no trip computer, can only display outside temp with trip odometer. Not what I would have expected from the EX-L. This will be my last Honda.

</DOC>
<DOC>


I have a red '08 V6 coupe. Noticed paint chipping around the rear tail lights and front lights. Had to have dealer remove lights, sand down edges, paint and reinstall. Driver side door handle sticks and dealer states there is no adjustment. Auto-transmission down-shifts abruptly, a lot of rattles and wind noise. Fit and finish is not typical Honda. If I were to buy again, I'd look at the Infiniti G-37.

Bought this car after having 7 Toyotas. Liked the looks and the value. However there are some issues. There is a white substance that comes through the heater/AC vents on the dash. Dealer has no idea what is causing this. States he will get back to me after talking to the factory, but so far nothing. Also the EX-L 4 cyl. needs power seats on the passenger side. Feels like your riding on the floor. Thought gas mileage would be better. Only getting 23 combined highway/city. My wife's Camry 4 cyl. gets 28 mostly city driving.

I have had my Accord for 7 months, just about 9,400 miles. I love it! I have had NO problems with it. I haven't had any back pain from the seats, maybe these people exceed the seat weight limit? My lights aren't flickering and there is no rattling. I don't think the engine is loud but that can be a matter of opinion. My basis for comparison were Hondas, Nissans and Toyotas all of which I have owned over the years.

I own a 2006 Maxima which is my daily driver, but on weekends and long trips I chose the Accord. It does not feel as powerful as the Maxima, even though it has about the same horse power rating, but it provides a much more satisfying driving experience, especially on long trips. I took the car on a trip to Quebec last summer. I never felt the fatigue experienced in most of my previous automobiles. It has good power, visibility, trunk space and nice handling. I love the fuel economy, the capability of using regular gas and work to cruise in the "econ" 3 cylinder mode. The car is an all around excellent performer!

I have had my car in the shop six times in the past two months to have various rattles and squeaks fixed and still haven't been able to clear them up. There are rattles coming from the rear of the car, even when I drive on smooth roads. The center console around the shift knob squeaks as well. The Honda dealer has not been helpful at all, usually ignoring my requests and not able to "find" the noises that I hear every day. Their response is that I have to expect to hear the noises as Honda doesn't use good insulation on their car bodies. I will keep that in mind when I shop for another car after Christmas.

Bought this car cert. 7 mo old with 13.5K miles, under $20K. For that price this is a fantastic luxurious coupe.There are trade offs that I have no problems with, my mileage after two tanks with mostly city driving is 21 but acceleration is very good, smooth, ride a little firm but enjoy the handling. I rode two hours home from the dealer and my back was sore for days. Have an old back injury. My thighs are lifted too high in the air. Feels like I am sitting in a bucket. A memory foam wedge pillow has made a world of difference. Compared to my Infiniti G20, this car feels huge. Comes with normal coupe blind spots. It is 6" wider and 13" longer than G20.

My second Accord after driving a 98 Accord over 200,000 miles. I am pleased although there is some road noise and the headlights flicker. MPG is from 28 to 30, mixed driving. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


I bought this car after much consideration of many models. I chose it for the low emissions, value for the money, reliability and gas mileage. It's a great car, I just miss my BMW which was way more fun to drive. I'm 6' tall, and find the driving position pretty comfortable. I get 27+ MPG in mixed driving, which is pretty good although it's annoying that I have to calculate it manually. (ok I'm either spoiled or lazy)

I did a lot of research before the purchase of my 2008 Accord EX-L. I looked at other cars like the infiniti G35 and 3-series. The Accord has some strengths 1) fuel economy 2) pickup 3) space 4) reliability. However, there are a couple of things that kill it for me 1) terrible driver seat comfort, kills my back 2) lack luster interior design, my Acadia has much better comfort 3) the VCM drives me crazy because the constant change in cylinder use is perceptible enough to be an annoyance. I will be trading this car in for a BMW 3-series in the spring.

I bought the loaded EX-V6 with leather for my wife after much research to replace a 2006 plain-Jane Avalon XL. My wife has been mad at me ever since. The EPA mileage ratings and what the dealer bragged about mileage wise are a joke. Supposed to be 19/29 for the V6 but it's been more like 17/23. We now have 15,000 miles and the best that we ever got on a road trip was 24. The brakes have squeaked from early on and after twice having the dealer tell us they couldn't recreate the sound we gave up. I've owned 5 Toyotas, 3 Infinitis, and 2 Nissans and I would gladly take any of them back over this car. There is a great deal of road noise in the cabin and the seats are very low quality.

After owning this car for only two months, I was involved in an accident that resulted in $11000 worth of damage to the vehicle. It got pinched between a semi trailer and a large flatbed truck resulting in a hit to the front left pillar. Long story short, what should have hit me in the face was deflected by the car. I walked away from this accident with only some minor scratches from broken glass though the car looked like it was totaled. I honestly believe that if I was driving my previous vehicle, I would be in the hospital right now.

Power seats are not fully adjustable. Shift hold control is a joke. 6-4-3 eco engine has poor performance and gas mileage of 22 highway. Not enough legroom for drivers over 6 ft. Front seats are too narrow and not deep enough. Radio has poor design... Too many buttons. Wrote Honda and complained about seat... They laughed. Will not buy another Honda.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Bought this car when they first came out. After a couple of months noticed the headlights flickering. Honda WILL NOT fix this car so it is now going to arbritration. This car is a disaster... road noise is horrible, stereo sucks, terrible gas mileage etc. Do not buy this car.

I had 2 Toyota Camrys and changing to the Accord, it's a great positive change. First better handling. Suspension is harder and the stability control made the car very fun to drive. Assisted brake is better than the Camry. More room. 2 big suitcases + 3 small ones when taking family from airport (we were 5). I can't even believe it can fit them all. Concerning some issues: road noise. I'm quite sensitive to noise and of course the noise canceling system is helping. Good point: it happens only time to time. The seat is slightly hard. I have to pull on the head rest and then it's ok. The 190 hp is there when needed. No regret compare to the Camry LE. MPG: 29 mpg mixed for the last 6000 miles!

</DOC>

This is my first Honda. Purchased it 4 months ago and am already looking to trade. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. There is an excessive amount of road noise and it's a very bumpy ride for a brand new car! Also, control panel is awkward. Loud rattling in the back when going over bumps and constantly squeaking brakes: the Honda mechanic told me both were normal and couldn't fix. The whole car just feels cheap.

<DOC>


This is my fifth Honda Accord and I have been impressed with the improvements made as we have come through the past 15 years. The 2008 body design is boring and outdated. Otherwise the gas mileage, service intervals, drive and dependability is still pristine. The added features with each new model have been exciting to use and the 2008 was no disappointment

</DOC>
<DOC>


I have had the car 6 month and taken 2 long distance trips. Overall, the car is great. I have has numerous other Honda's and this one is at the toip of the list. I traded an 05 Acura TL for the gas mileage savings. While the Accord is no Acura it is a close relative in terms of quality and comfort. I am averaging 24-25 MPH in town and get close to 32 on the highway. I miss my Acura, but the Accord is a good substitute.

</DOC>
<DOC>


This is a smooth car. I previously owned a 98 Avalon, and found the seats more comfortable than the Honda. The seats in the Honda are more firm. I found the Accord to handle better than the Camry. I test drove them back to back. I commute 25 miles to work, 90% highway, and average 24 to 27mpg depending how I drive. I recently drove 300 miles one way with my wife and 2 kids. The trunk was packed full of luggage. The cruise was set at 70 mph and got 31.3 mpg. I did not do as well on the way back because of Wisconsin cold weather and wind, but averaged 28 mpg over 600 miles including 50 miles driving around Milwaukee. The VCM works best with no hills, and I find it to be nearly seamless.

This is my 1st Honda. I have been disappointed with some aspects of the car. 1.) Hwy fuel economy was a boasted 42 mpg. I have eked out 35.5 mpg with a tail wind, egg shell under the throttle, not exceeding 100 km/h. You start driving with a heavy foot and the hwy numbers fall into the 27-28 mpg range. 2.) No shiftronic/manumatic mode. This is a nice feature for sporty driving and saving wear and tear on your brakes, Honda does not offer it on the 08 Accord. I had a 2007 Altima V6 for a few months and it was faster, more fun to drive and smoother than the Accord. 3.) no cargo nets in the trunk? 4.) A/C stopped working due to Puron leak other minor quality problems need work.

My first new car in years, I had researched this car online for months! The test drive was great and I loved the car until I drove it out of town (trip lasted 2 hours) and developed back pain. Thought I was just getting old but it never improved and I was amazed to see all the other drivers who had the same problem. I've already been through 2 set of wiper blades after 6 months and had the weatherstripping around the back doors replaced once. And my headlights blink too! I'm very sad - I loved my daughter's Civic and the dealer service is fantastic, but even good service can't help the uncomfortable seats.

</DOC>
<DOC>


The car which does every thing right is getting wrong, build quality is down from last few generations. Lost the battery charging in just 3 hours of leaving the door open and radio on! The engine starts as if there is lot of load on it (4cl) - not a very peppy engine - I may be wrong here because all the time I have used Pontiac GTO, CTS, Impala 3.8, Maxima and Honda's V6. I wouldn't recommend this car due to the fact that the quality of build is not up to Honda's standards.

</DOC>
<DOC>


I bought this car for two reasons: 1) I've owned four Hondas previously and all were great. 2) This car looks sharp. This car rattles on the dash, passenger side, and rear deck. I brought this back to the dealer twice, but they couldn't help me. Honda of America is a big letdown on this one. I had to drive around with the glove box open to stop the squeaking since it was sitting in wrong. After the dealer couldn't fix things, I decided to fix it myself by breaking the weld on the latch, moving it then re-welding it myself. Glove box no longer squeaks but it masked about three or four other rattles from various locations. Time for me to call it quits and get a better car.

Recently i made couple of big trips of 700 miles or so, and after that I had terrible back pain. Even for the 1-2 hours ride I had the back pain, must say that seat design is horrible. Overall performance is good but comfort level is poor.

</DOC>
<DOC>


I traded my 01 v-6 sedan in for the 08 v-6 coupe and it's a totally different drive. I'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains. The ride is a great balance between handling and comfort.

Got rid of my 2006 AUDI A6 and bought this. Thousands of dollars cheaper! Runs better than AUDI A6 - Better Mileage + more HP. Bought last week ( 10/14/2008 ) 2008 Accord v6 at $5000 below MSRP and LOVE IT! 

</DOC>
<DOC>


I just traded this car after owning it for a few months! It cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of it, but the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving! No one, the dealer or American Honda, would help me. Take a long test drive before buying this car. Wish I had! Buyer beware!

</DOC>

This is my first Honda and my last. Although it is fun to drive and quality seems ok, the leather seats are very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive. The sound system is terrible on the highway because of road noise. No compass except when nav is on. Mileage is as advertised. I am starting to look for a replacement.

</DOC>
<DOC>


I have owned this coupe for 2 months now, and overall I am happy with the purchase. Definitely different than driving an Expedition. Gas mileage at first wasn't great but having reached 2500 miles, it seemed to go up dramatically in city driving. 17 mpg average to 20.7 mpg average. Hwy avg. mpg is 26, but haven't gone out of town lately, it may be more. VCM/ECO did surge a lot when I first bought it, now just does it ever so often, usually only when accelerating from a low speed. Ride is great, power is awesome.

</DOC>
<DOC>


This is my first Honda, and WOW! Traded in my elantra at 33 MPG but with the VCM in my new Coupe, I am getting 28.4 MPG on last fill up. Love the interior and the power and speed, but not hard to beat after what I had. Drove an Altima (3.5 V-6 coupe) and the accord was a major step up and less a price. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


Leased in Feb 2008 as a replacement to a Pilot, which had poor gas mileage. I do miss the carry and load capacity of the Pilot, but the Accord gets decent gas mileage by comparison (about 24 MPG combined, around 28 MPG hwy). The 4 cylinder is plenty powerful for me. Can't beat the price I got ($3300 down, $159/mo) for a 3 year/12,000 mile per year lease. Being on the West Coast I was able to pick between Accords made in the U.S. and one made in Japan, and chose the JHM VIN number. So far no problems, ride is smooth, a bit loud on rough roads. This is my 10th Honda, and I continue to be a Honda fan.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Although not the fastest, most luxurious, or technologically advanced in the very competitive mid-size sedan segment, the Accord strikes the perfect balance of sport, comfort and value, creating a vehicle that feels and acts like a much pricier machine. Indeed, the hi-revving engine, tight suspension and precise steering have almost a Bavarian feel to it.

I have a 2008 EX-L V6. Took delivery on 21 Dec 07 and have since put just under 15,000 miles on it. Considering the price it is probably the best car on the road today. It has room, performance, good MPG for its size and excellent reliability. The v6 is smooth and unlike some articles I have seen about the V6 with variable displacement technology I have not experienced any surging. Engine is most smooth. In this weak economy you should be able to buy an Accord for no more than dealer invoice. That is exactly what I paid for my 2008 in Dec 2007. In fact I am thinking you should be able to get it for $500 below dealer invoice and without dealer add-ons.

Just completed my first week in my 42 month lease in Honda EXL-V6 and can't be happier! Thanks to Edmunds usual accurate reviews, I chose the Honda over many other cars. Love the interior and exterior look, the V6 is sensational, and getting compliments on the steel metallic color as if it's a Lexus or BMW. Last tank of gas got 24 MPG. For the record I test-drove the Lexus350 the BMW 5 series, the infiniti G35 and enjoyed the Honda performance equally for far less money! Edmunds has guided me through a 1997, first year C5 Corvette, a 2002 Infiniti G35 and others, always being on target! I thought that I was downgrading, but5 I love the Honda. Thanks Edmunds.

After six months and 8500 miles this is my impression. Yes, the Accord looks nice and has been reliable. Has lots of features, is comfortable, everything works. The downside: Although the engine is quiet, there are quite noticeable surges from the transmission even with cruise control on. The surges are very noticeable also in heavy stop and go traffic. My old Buicks had far smoother shifts at far higher mileage. Bumpy roads have too much of an effect on the steering and braking. I am surprised they would design the exterior so that rain always comes in the windows unless they are completely shut. Sometimes I need to activate the remote more than once to open the doors.

I loved this car when I took it for a test drive. I was a Toyota fan for years, but this time Honda won me over. My decision came down to the Camry or Accord. I decided to go for the car with more pep (Accord) rather than the one with the smoother and quieter ride (Camry). I thought I could just turn up the stereo to drown out the Accord's notorious road noise. Boy was I wrong. The premium sound system is below par any other standard sound systems I've had in any of my previous low end models (various makes). I took the car back to the dealership and was told there was nothing that could be done, this was the premium system and there are no upgrades available.

My 2 door Accord coupe v-6 looks and rides great. The 268 horses work just fine. The VCM works perfectly and has not given me any problems. The brakes could be better in order to stop after hard acceleration. I love the way the automatic shifts and down shifts as you are coming to a stop. If you are looking for a nice 2 door coupe this is it. My old solara was a truck next to the Accord

I've owned Honda for the last 20 years, but this is the cheapest quality Honda out there. Inside you see six different style cheap plastic which feels like they found from junk yard. This car has excessive road noise appears to have no insulation to cut cost. The chief engineer should be fired!

</DOC>
<DOC>


I have had the car for nearly six months now and overall I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. The two door coupe is very comfortable and roomy and draws plenty of attention. The seats are decent, the interior design is excellent IMO as well as the exterior design, and thus far it has been extremely reliable. The build quality could be a tad bit better (less wind noise), but it's not horrible. I looked at a ton of cars before this purchase many of which were entry level luxury sedans costing 5-10k dollars more and could not justify buying any of them over the accord. You get a lot of car loaded with options for the money. I paid 26k for mine before tt&l.

</DOC>
<DOC>


I didn't notice it when I did the test drive but after driving the car I realized I really made a big mistake here. The seat is extremely uncomfortable. My back is in pain each time I get out of the car. I have no complaints about anything else. In fact, I love the car just wish Honda wouldn't have made such horrible seats. Seriously, there is a metal plan that will stick right into your back. I called Honda and they said it was there for safety. I think it is just really bad design. Just make sure to take a really long test drive.

This is my 2nd accord. I am changing from a '04 Maxima. It has excellent gas mileage drove from PHX to San on a half a gas of tank. Feels very light and responsive love the ability to be more agile. Ive gotten a lot of compliments even for just being a Accord. Have had no problems with blinking headlights.

When I first received this car 11-2007, I noticed that the it was hard to shift into 3rd gear and would often pop out of 3rd gear and was told at the dealership that this would go away at around 10,000 miles well it did not. So then they replaced the gears and a week later fourth gear went out; thus every time I tried to put it into fourth gear yesterday and it would pop out again along with making a very high pitch sound but was not raising the revs on the tach Meter. Today it made high whining sounds in every gear and I barely made it to the dealership today. The dealer had my car for two days last week and will have my car for 4 days this week, I sure hope Honda can fix this.

only 900 miles but drives much better than others on market. more hp and room than previous accord which was great as well, the handling is way better on the 08 also. gas mileage sucks, i was getting 20 mpg on 05 accord v6 and seem to pull only 18 mpg on this one. mostly city driving though.

We have been buying a Honda Accord sedan every five years for the last thirty years, with the last purchase being the 2008 Accord V6 EX-L. Compared to my 2003 V6 EX-L Accord Sedan, the 2008 seems way to big even though the difference in size is only a few inches. My 2003 drives and feels like a (semi) sports car and the 2008 drives and feels like a full size fat nose sedan, which it is. If you need to haul three adults around in the back seat, then get a 2008-2009, but if you like a sporty car that is fun to drive, then I would suggest that you get a different make of car, as Honda has abandoned its basic principles of making sedans that are fun to drive.

This is my third Accord and will be the last. The car is big and ponderous. It does not track straight. Constantly steering corrections to the right or left to keep the car go straight. The driver's seat is very uncomfortable. The head rest tills forward which pushes the driver's head forward at a very uncomfortable position. The seat is too deep that the edge cuts into the driver's calves. The arm rest on the door is too far away to rest your arm. Build quality is lacking. The car is under powered.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Pluses: Great visibility, good braking. Very good handling Negatives: Poor wipers, high level of road noise, dashboard controls are not intuitive, heating is inconsistent, windshield almost always fogs which makes it necessary to leave defroster on. Acceleration with the four cylinder is not good. Sound is only mediocre. Gas mileage is only 20 around town and 26 to 27 on the highway with a four!

Beautiful car, got one of the first cars at the dealer when they came out. Very happy with the car enjoy the ride and performance. I am having early wear on the brake, shimmy at 60 mph with 20K miles on the car. Possible design issue, dealer reviewing. Mileage is disappointing.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Overall experience has been very good. The cars ride and styling are very nice. I do have to agree with other reviews in several areas, excessive road noise and the VCM is very noticeable. If I could turn off the VCM I would and sacrifice the 1 mpg. Come on Honda...would installing a little insulation for the road noise hurt your bottom line that much.

This car looks ugly in person. It looks better on magazine. The headlights and trunk is ugly design. Had this car for 2 months and sold it. Took two hours trip to the mountain. This car has two problems. Has horrible road noise coming into the car and headlights is NOT bright enough. I don't recommend this car for the price. Nissan Altima is better car.

The car has met expectations, aside from the gas mileage and wind noise. It's my first Honda.

The 2008 Honda Accord is my first foreign car as it was the only fuel- efficient and powerful 4 cylinder in a family-sized mid size sedan which made overall sense. It has attention grabbing styling from most angles and is yet still a fairly modest car! The front driver seat's lumbar support seemed very uncomfortable at first. The dashboard angles out to much at the perimeter and "invites" you to bump your leg or knee when entering or exiting in a trade off between style and practicality. Perhaps even more annoying is the side windows curve inward too much in accommodating a narrower roof line resulting rain pouring into the vehicle unless are windows virtually shut. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


I got fascinated by the fuel efficiency before buying this car. It was misleading advertisement. My car gives me 450 km with full tank (70 liters). Almost half the mileage as compared to advertisement. I have 2000 Toyota sienna, with 67 liters of fuel it goes more than 500 km. Bigger size, big engine and better fuel efficient than brand new 2008 Honda Accord ex-l (2.4l). I realize that I made a mistake, I should have bought the Toyota Camry instead.

Bought the vehicle in May 2008. Two weeks into having the vehicle a slight grinding noise started to occur after starting the ignition. As the weeks passed the noise became louder. Took it to get serviced and they replace the starter. Two days after picking up the vehicle from being serviced the same noise started to occur again. It's back at the shop and waiting to see what happens next. It may just be bad luck. Another issue I have is the acceleration. There is a 1 sec delay when accelerating. If your trying to move on the highway give yourself some time. The 4 cycl is sufficient but I'm sure a 6 cycl would provide better acceleration response.

I am really disappointed in my vehicle. The outside is gorgeous, but that isn't what matters. The blinking headlights at night are extremely dangerous. It causes my eyes to get out of focus for a moment and get strained. It happens around every 20 seconds. It brings on my migraines because the lights flash so frequently. Many times people have flashed their brights on me because they think I'm flashing mine at them. At first the Gas mileage was very poor but has really improved. The road noise is terrible. The car feels like it is shifting to often and jerks the car in an annoying way off and on. Not worth the money. Really take some time and don't rush into purchasing this car.

Seriously, reading some of these petty reviews makes me realize that NO CAR would make these picky people happy. Here's a REAL REVIEW. This car is everything you would want in an everyday, modest car. The car is comfortable and QUIET. Even in Chicago, Pothole-laden roads..bumps are feather light and I could fall asleep driving. The Hands free is great. Had to buy a new phone since my old one wasn't compatible. No big deal The car is huge and very comfortable. My lower back was sore after a 5 hours drive to STL. Body wasn't used to seats like if you bought a new mattress. I get 27 mpg - 31mpg. Take the time to break the car in correctly. be gentle.

This is my first Accord. I chose it over the Civic. I prefer a car with 4 wheel disc brakes and after dressing up the Civic the price was very close to the Accord LX. I am 6'4" in height and I fit better in the Accord. The car drives well. Highway I am getting 35 mpg. City mileage is at 25 mpg. The paint is good quality. I always hand wax a new car the day I get it to look for flaws or scratches and found the finish to be fine. It drives very well and has a solid feel on the road at freeway speeds. I wanted an inexpensive car with good mileage, and strong resale. This car meets my expectations.

Excellent car! Have put on 6000 miles, so far, very good. Smooth, not as loud as some indicated. 4 cyl 190 HP engine, best in class. Very good mileage, getting about 28 mpg combined highway, and I have a heavy foot. Drives more like a BMW, but a fraction of the cost. Loaded with just about everything you think of. Past Honda Accord driver, no doubt, this is the best they produced. Very tight, runs great, very comfortable to drive. Compared to many sedans in this market, and all are very good cars. The accord comes out on top.

Bought my Accord back in May of 2008. So far I get 28-29 MPG in mixed driving. The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats. The dashboard is very well lit, but the stereo system is horrible, it seems to have too much bass when set at zero. Road noise is also bad, my Accord does not have a noise damper on the hood like my old Accord had. Whenever the car is cold, the brakes always make noise, after it has warmed up, it goes away. For some reason, when I use the windshield defroster, I hear the Air conditioner motor on (Don't think that's normal at all). As with other threads I've read, yes, the Accord should come with a semi auto and projector lights.

I just purchased my EX 4 days ago and all I can say is it is a gorgeous car. I did my homework and test drove many cars including the Nissan Altima 2.5S and Toyota Camry SE and LE. First off the paint finish on the silver Accord was by far the best. The interior design was much nicer. The Altima had the best transmission and extras like intelligent key but the dashboard was ugly and the paint seemed thin and had bigger blind spots. The Camry was a close second but I really liked the Accord's look better I got the Accord for $600 under invoice with the help of edmunds.com. The Accord has a distinct tightness when driving and a solid resale value. A+++++

The first 1,500 miles have been a lot of fun. I am very pleased with the cornering and superb handling of this car. Initially the dashboard controls were a little intimidating, but it doesn't take long to get comfortable with them. Everything is placed perfectly. Voice commands are logical and easy to remember. I've been averaging 28 mpg per tank since about 1,000 miles. No problems. Glad I made the right choice.

This is the best built car I have ever owned. After having a awful 2005 Chevy Malibu Maxx I bought my first non American in 37 years. My last one was a 1971 Dodge Colt. This car has a great ride, great looks, and I got 28 mpg in city driving. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


First I am 6'4" and 235 lbs. I fit in the Coupe comfortably. The seat has to be far back so my head does not hit the ceiling. Leg room is adequate. The interior is nicely equipped and I like the XM radio but not the monthly fee. The exterior is ok and looks pretty sharp in the metallic color. The ride is somewhat rough and very noisy. My Toyota Tacoma truck is quieter than this Honda when traveling at high speed. I drive a Charger at work and the Charger rides nicer and is quieter as well. The 4 cylinder is very slow when you need it to go from a dead stop. Go for the 6 cylinder if you can afford it. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


Looking at the many other coupes available, this is the best car for the money. The EX-L comes with many standard options that make you feel like you're driving a luxury car. Overall very happy with the car, plus I have been asked many times about it on the street. People just look at and smile!

</DOC>
<DOC>


Handling is excellent. Fuel economy is about what I had with my previous V-6. I hoped for a little better. The performance of the engine is very smooth. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


What can I say? It's a Honda. The American car builders should have been shadowing these guys 15 years ago. I've never felt so secure and safe in a relatively small car. I bought the V6 for the extra sprint power which makes the car safer, but knocks down the MPG to 24 or so. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


I traded in my 01 Acura CLS and thought I might be moving down a notch. Other than a less powerful and somewhat noisier engine, the Honda is about as nice (a lot less money too). The styling of both the Accord and Altima coupe got my attention, but this car gives you more for the money. My experience with the dealership was positive as well.

</DOC>
<DOC>


For the price, this car is an outstanding value that wreaks high quality. The 190 hp I4 engine is powerful and smooth enough to enjoy, without sacrificing fuel mileage. The new styling is very upscale, and the interior layout is also impressive and spacious inside. My only reservations are the ivory cloth interior's durability (had to have taffeta white!), and the hvac/stereo plastic trim panel creaks like crazy when it's hot outside.

Our family was badly in need of a car. Starting price of anything of any type of quality was approx. 25K. Looked at several vehicles. Jetta TDI: great mileage, poor build quality of the car. Passat: nice car, add'l $$ for premium gas, not as big of interior as accord, dealer that we would utilize for service not clean. Volvo S40: nice car, small in size, about same as Jetta, very well built. Accord Sedan 4 cyl: great car, great quality. Our winner: Accord Sedan EX-L V6: great car, great quality, excellent fit and finish, lifetime dealer warranty on eng/trans, ULEV/PZEV, power when needed/wanted, best financing avail., nearly identical mpg as 4 cylinder d/t VCM.

After 8 months and reading some of these reviews I had to chime in. The v6 in my car is awesome. My 5th Accord, 3 had over 300k miles on them. I get 32.7 mpg hwy and 25 hwy when I drive good. When I drive nutty its substantially lower (to be expected by anyone with a brain). People seem to think you can buy something new and abuse it. The car needs to be properly broken is to get the best out of it. I like the option of changing the locking and unlocking of the doors to my preferences. I also have an s2000 another super car. I refused to trade my 1991 Accord in because at 263,000 miles it is still running so good. The oldie will be the parking lot ding car .

I've had 2 Accords before this one, both of them were 2002, and both were leagues better than this one. This car had rattles at 500 miles and has horrible performance even for a four cylinder. The car hesitates when accelerating. When paying 22k for a new car, it should be solid and not have any squeaks or rattles. I am very disappointed with this car. On top of all this, I get horrible gas mileage; in city driving I get 15-16 mpg. Apparently the car isn't broken in yet, but I know someone who has a new 4 cyl Accord which is past the break-in period, and he also gets around 17 mpg. I would NOT recommend this car to anyone. Go for the Camry; I test drove it, and it's much better than this car

</DOC>
<DOC>


I have 12,500 miles on the Accord. It gets great gas mileage and love the car. I don't agree with the oil life gauge but the dealer said if I change it any sooner, I'll mess with the scheduled maintenance. How will an engine last 300k mles with the oil changed every 10,000 miles? The rock chips on the front of the car are annoying. Horrible road noise and now I have what sounds's like a front wheel bearing gone bad! Also my lights dim every time the a/c kicks on! HMMMMMM!

Traded in my 2006 Accord SE. Loved it. The driver seat in the 2008 is much more comfy. Pick-up is much worse. Stereo sound quality is worse. There is much more room in the 08. Ride noise is similar. Tires on the 06 were of better quality - I got over 80,000 on my 06 Michelins. So it's a mixed bag. Overall, I'm satisfied. The 08 is a nice car and still offers the best combination of size and fuel efficiency.

This 2008 EXL V6 is my sixth Accord. I had planned to get the 3 series BMW, but the Accord is a better value. The car is much larger inside. I don't like the dash/radio assembly, but the interior has a luxury look. The major problem is the horrible road noise. The stereo shop will charge me $600 for sound deadening. Acceleration is mediocre. Idle isn't as smooth as my other Accords. I hear a knock occasionally after it starts, but Honda can't replicate the problem. Mileage over three tanks has been 25.43 (mixed): 25.03 (mostly city); and 26.0 (highway). You don't get a trip computer unless you spend several thousand on the NAVI. Fix the road noise and this car becomes really good.

I just purchased an Accord Sedan (fully loaded) with leather seats. I was originally in the market for an Acura and compared the both and chose the Accord. They are very similar as far as engine and design on the inside. The difference to me is the body style. I really really love my new car. It rides smooth, roomy, great horsepower and maintains the road well. I put it on the road a week ago and road noise is not a problem. This is the best car I've ever purchased. It took me two years to make up my mind in what would be my next car and I wouldn't have it no other way. I get compliments and praises everywhere I go. The black on black, 2008 Honda Accord Sedan EX-L V6 is MY new Lexus!

Nice looking car. Averaged 24 miles to the gallon for city+highway driving. Not too happy with this. So far we have 1500 miles. Handles Beautifully. Road Noise is too high.

Convinced my wife she should get a Honda for reliability, quality, resale yada yada. She gave up her 04 Cadillac CTS. The car does have good styling, Seems economical compared to the CTS. One of the nosiest vehicles I've ever driven. I have to assume Honda is trying to keep the weight down by limiting insulation. Tires may also contribute. Compare it to a Malibu if you can. Difference in sound level is unbelievable. The driver seating is uncomfortable. I'm 6'3" 245. Probably the most unbelievable to me is what must be a totally inadequate electrical system that allows marginal headlights to dim when the A/C Compressor cycles. Had a 72 Datsun that did that. Wife loves her car.

Nice exterior design that is a great parallel to the Civic coupe. Can't go anywhere without drawing stares, big smiles, and being constantly asked "wow, what is that"? (must confess I removed all badging, did mild window tint . So only the grill emblem gives it away and most look at the whole picture). After 12,000 miles, 24.6 mpg overall avg. With 30.3 mpg as consistent full tank highway mileage. This has been a terrific driver with no functional or quality issues. Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2-tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better tilt. Lose the cheap automatic shifter . This is not 1980! Awesome coupe

I purchased this vehicle thinking that I was going to get a solid, well-built car. For the most part I did with the exception of noisy, squeaky brakes and rattling behind the back speakers. The car drives great and gets better gas mileage than my 2000 Lincoln LS V8. I did take a 3 hour trip in it and my back started hurting 2 hours in. I'm only 22! Dealership experience has been pleasant and the car has a great sound system. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It looks great, handles well, and gets good gas mileage. I avg about 25 mpg.

Overall very good car so far. Had it for a few days and no complaints. I had qualms about the exterior but its growing on me. I was thinking about getting the 2009 acura tsx but opted for the 08 accord because it was more roomier, family friendly, used regular fuel, and cost several thousand less. Biggest plus I think is the roominess of the interior and the trunk. Fits a full sized stroller with plenty of room left.

This Accord is a great auto I have owned a new 1994 and 1997 Accord this by far the best design. The ride is very good The interior is awesome.Great features for the money.

I have owned three Accords and by far this is the worst vehicle. The VCM system is horrible. I now have 5,000 miles and the situation is getting worse. You don't notice it until you reach cruising speed between 65-70 MPH. The ECO light is on but the car continues to fight between cylinder selection. This surge feeling actually makes you feel sick at times. I looked at the Chevy Malibu and decided to stick with Honda due to previous experience. I made a big mistake..!

I just bought this car in July (2008) and overall it is a beautiful car. It has nice styling resembling that of a BMW, with the hofmeister kinked window line, uncurved rear door outline, and bold lines. It's a comfortable ride and is very high quality. However, right after I bought it, my brakes were making a rumbling sound/feel, so I took it to the dealer and they installed new rear rotors under warranty. That just didn't seem right to me for a new car to have such an issue. Overall it's a great buy for a family or individual who needs the space. The car is pretty large and bulky, though That's not necessarily a bad thing.

</DOC>

This is my 7th Honda and 4th Accord. The car rides better than previous generations. However, I cannot get better than 23 miles to the gallon, even on the highway! I drive the same way I did in my 2004 Accord that got 33 MPG. I expect much more from Honda. The dealership said everything checks out, so it is just the way they built the car. Too bad. As much as I love Hondas, they can never seem to get everything working at the same time.

</DOC>

So after 18k miles my review still doesn't get any better. The gas mileage has improved from 18MPG to 21 but that still is not good. I currently need new brakes (front & back) which i've never had to get brakes before 30k miles. I do not have a heavy foot for braking. The vibration between 60-70 MPH still exists. Acceleration seems to be getting weaker and weaker. Road noise in the beginning was bad now it's even worse.

Have had my Accord for 3 months. Was going to buy new Explorer but gas prices changed my mind. Once I test drove this car I was hooked. For a 4 cylinder car I am surprised at the comfortable and peppy drive. Recently went to Cape Cod and averaged 34mpg. Overall, I've been averaging about 25 mpg. For the money, I do not think you can find a better value. The nav system is great. Also test drove the Altima. It was a tough decision, but the Accord is a better looking car and slightly bigger. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


I've had this car for about 5 months now and it's a pretty nice car. It has decent speed with a really smooth motor. I don't really feel the VCM kicking in for the most part, so I really don't mind it. Gas mileage has been a bit disappointing, but it has been improving. I've averaged about 23.5 mpg, but was expecting much better with the VCM technology. Ride and handling are great. I'm still getting use to the "bigness" of this vehicle as I still sometimes feel like it is just too big for a coupe. Nav has been very useful, but at times has trouble finding everyday stuff like a Costco. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the vehicle.

I've had my sedan for a month now and am very happy with it. Driving this car is simply effortless - the engine is smooth and responsive, the steering is perfectly tight without feeling heavy, and the suspension handles corners well without feeling harsh over bumps. I've made several 3+ hour trips with it and never felt worn out like I did with my previous car (a Pontiac Grand Prix).

Have had my Accord coupe for a week and it gets a thumbs-up thus far! Traded in my 99 Mustang GT convertible as I changed jobs and needed a more practical commuter car. This a good choice if (like me) you need an affordable and comfortable commuting vehicle but hate the idea of a boring boxy sedan. The Accord Coupe is stylish and sporty. Thought about the V6 but the 190-horsepower base engine has plenty of power for normal driving and passing.

I've always owned Hondas from the days of the hatch back civic to now this 08 accord.I am pleased with everything so far.

The 2008 Honda Accord V6 is one of the most annoying cars to drive between the vibration in the steering at speeds above 50 mph and the engine constantly changing the number of cylinders that are firing. In 3 cylinder mode it feels and sounds as if the engine is misfiring. The gas tank sloshes if the tank is above 3/4 full (the baffles do not extend to the top of the inside of the tank to prevent the gas from sloshing around). The XM satellite radio frequently loses signal as you drive down the road. Round noise prevents the radio from being heard well on the highway. If you stop and then turn going uphill, the transmission down shifts violently throwing everyone in the car. 

</DOC>

The 2008 Accord is the first Honda I've ever owned. This is one great automobile. the fit and finish is unmatched. not a single item needed post purchase service or attention. The engine and transmission is the smoothest unless compared with a vehicle costing $20k more. the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage. I highly recommend the Honda Accord.

Had a 2004 Acura TL and traded for a 2008 coupe and couldn't be happier. Looks great inside and out and I feel a real competitor to the Infiniti G37 at thousands less. Spend a lot of time on the road and the car is never boring to drive in city or highway. Great performance and handling make this a real Winner!

I wanted to get a nice sedan with a standard shift. The Accord EX-L 5- speed fit the bill. I enjoy driving the car each and every day (even to work). The 4 cylinder engine is just right for quick acceleration and highway cruising. I get 25 MPG in mixed driving and 31 MPG on the highway. The ownership experience has been excellent. Dealer service is done with a smile.

After driving my old accord to almost 250,000 I bought this beautiful 2008 EX-L accord. What a car, design, ride, comfort, 270 watt audio system, I love this car.

Reading the reviews has me puzzled; either people love the car or hate it. Honda always made cars that were more sporty than American cars and Camry. Had a 1994 Honda Accord with almost 120,000 miles on it and will miss it. Overall the car is great: more room, more power, just as sporty as always (firm seats/ride).

Lots of the reviews are complaining about the MPG - it states clearly at Honda that the 4 cyl only gets 2 MPG better than the 6cyl, which is why I went with the 6cyl. If I need some power, I want it available. If you want 40 MPG, buy a little tin-can eco compact car (which = death in an accident). It's not a Chevy Tahoe, it's an accord! The MPG for this type of vehicle is great, so lets just get real people. I just bought this car, only 200 miles on it, so i haven't settled in enough to have a great review on it as far as ride quality. I've been a BMW driver for the past 10 yrs, and I like feeling stuck to the ground, this car feels very sturdy and weighted, which I like. Good handling.

Worst Accord Design Ever! And this engine is going in the 2009 Pilot??? I've owned six previous Accords and LOVED them all. I've have a 2008 Accord V6 EX with the infamous VCM engine. After multiple trips back to the dealer and various "fixes" (wheel balance, turned rotors, computer upgrade), the ride in this car is torture. The driver's seat redesign gives me a back/head ache after only a 10 mile highway drive to work. The VCM engine causes constant, violent shifts, shimmy and vibrations. So glad that I found this forum because the 2008 Accord V6 VCM engine is Honda's best kept, dirty little secret. Let's spread the word and force Honda to acknowledge this engine design nightmare.

After owning a Honda Accord EX (totaled), Volkswagen Passat wagon (engine water damage), and Mazda c-x7 (trade-in) I had to go back to the Honda the gas mileage can't be beat. Love the smooth 5-speed manual and adore the quiet ride. I can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason I was able to go back the the Honda family.

I purchased this car based on past experiences with Honda. After almost 5,000 miles, I have no complaints. Gas mileage is around 22-23 in town and 29-30 on the highway. The longest trip was 500 miles and the car was a pleasure to drive the entire time. I'm 6'2" and have plenty of room.

I bought this car lightly used (19K miles) a few months ago. The EX is THE model to get. I have been very happy with this car so far. It replaced a '97 Camry 4cyl and since it is a much larger/safer/heavier/more powerful car, it gets a little less MPG. With conservative driving, I get about 24 city/34 hwy (properly manually calculated). The seats are very comfortable & supportive. I test drove an EX-L and felt the seats were too firm (plus, the EX-L seemed too slow..maybe not broken in yet). FWIW, mine is from Japan. I drove/compared to a dozen other cars.

Had to replace my rear breaks at 22k miles. According to Honda it is normal. I get about 24 MPG and 7500-9000 miles per oil change. Tires are in great condition after 34k miles on them, should last another 30-35k.

</DOC>
<DOC>


I thought I was buying quality with Honda, however when a new vehicle needs new rear brakes at 27000 miles that is unacceptable. Especially when the dealer ship admitted it was a flawed design but still would only fix the problem for $330.00 before taxes. That is insane to think customers will come back to Honda with a reputation they are getting by not dealing with the brake problems. Honda needs to recall the brakes and reimburse all of us who made the mistake to purchase this vehicle. My advise to people is do not buy a Honda until they gain my trust again.

I liked the accord coupe since the first time I saw the Concept car back in 2007... it was other level of creation for a coupe. This car has everything, it looks GREAT in and out, and the sound of the engine (V6) uuuuufffff... Amazing!!!

I've had this car about 2 years now and am at 55k miles. This car is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. I do a ton of driving for my job and can get up to 34 mpg driving on the hwy. You can't beat that with a car that looks and performs like the 2dr accord. The only maintenance I've had outside of oil changes and tire rotations is having to replace the rear break pads at 52k. I can't say enough about this car, if you are looking for a dependable good looking car, get the accord, you wont be disappointed.

I like my Accord very much, but had I known the drivers seat was so uncomfortable I would have never bought it. It's really hard to tell when you take a car for a 10 minute test drive, but now that I own it, I can't drive for more than an hour without back pain (I'm only 26!). And forget the so called "lumbar support". You'd be better off putting a brick behind your back (whats in that seat, iron?). Overall, I have no other complaints about the car. I did have one experience during a winter snowstorm when the check engine light came on. Took it to the shop and by that time, it was already off and they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Fun to drive, stylish, etc.

I love my 2008 Honda Accord EX- L with only 1 exception. The rear brakes need to be replaced every year. Honda has a Major problem with their rear brakes. Just do a simple search on the internet and you will found thousands of complaints about the rear brakes going out in their new car any where from 6 -18 months. Honda still will not admit to the problem and I still have to shell out $250 bucks every time to fix the brakes.

This is my fourth Accord and Honda got most of it right. My 2008 190 HP EX-L Coupe is perfect for around town and short trips. The high end sound system is very good. Fit and finish and ergonomics are as you would expect from a Honda, very good. This Accord has more road noise than I like and the seats tend to be hard, unlike my other Accords. The V6 would be a better choice for folks that go on long road trips, have longer commutes or do allot of freeway driving. The rear brakes had to be serviced at 20k miles. Honda acknowledged that this was an issue and pro rated the fix. The Clear Coat may be an issue as it was on earlier Accords. Fuel mileage has been less than expected.

OK, compared to some cars, it may seem underpowered, but the reward comes at the fuel pump. Fun is still a standard feature with the Manual Transmission. Absolutely no regrets here. Got my Acura CL without the high price...

The only cars I've ever owned have been Mustangs (last 2 were GT's). After having yet another problem with the 'stang, I decided to trade it in and drove past Honda. The minute I saw the Accord, I liked it. I doubted that the 4 cylinder would be enough power, but I test drove it and it's quick. It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems. The major factor in my decision was that it's also recommended in Consumer Reports. I didn't want another pile of car crap that was going to give me issues, and Honda has an excellent reputation. The rear is not the most attractive, but I plan on getting a body kit installed, so it wasn't a factor.

I traded my 1997 Eclipse Spyder GST convertible (turbo 4 cyl/5MT) for an Accord EX-L sedan (4 cyl/5MT) when I turned 60. Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort. I averaged 34-35 mpg after 6000 miles (~90% highway driving). Lowest mpg was 29 mpg (~50% local driving with A/C); highest mpg was 40 mpg (driving 60 mph w/o A/C on Midwest highways). This Accord is the only large car I found with upscale comfort/amenities and a good manual transmission. The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage.

The car is great. It looks and drives very well. Comfort inside is better than expected. Worst issue is Gas Consumption, this thing averages 18 MPG for city and hwy combined. This is with normal driving . Honda does not care or want to do anything about it. So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case.

I just traded in my 2007 Jeep GC, for this car. I love it so much, it was a great purchase. The car is getting great gas mileage (28 mpg) even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks. I expect it to break in about 3 months. I find that the features of the car are super nice for a low-end model. Daytime running lights, rain sensing wipers, Text display radio w/MP3, steering wheel controls, AUX input. Most of these I did not even get on my $30K Jeep. Maybe i am used to driving a 6-cyl, but this car is fast from 0-60 for just a 4-cyl. Great speed in 2nd and 3rd gear. Only downside so far was the wheels. I plan to buy some nice rims in the spring.

Purchased my car around a month ago Very happy to ride it. Very smooth, easy to handle, makes whatever I want. Did a few trips Cupertino - Monterey, Cupertino-Santa Cruz Very happy with in in the city, on highway, on mountain road. Can make any curve. Sometimes I feel that engine is not powerful enough, for example, when I go uphill by highway , but I never tried to use full-throttle up to now Very space, luxury inside. Like navigational system, it find very good routes.

After driving a 2003 Toyota Camry for 5 years happily, I was sure to I was going to replace it with another Camry. However after checking out the '09 Camry, I was disappointed with the quality of the interior and outdated dash . After seeing the Honda Accord, I was thrilled. I purchased a new 2008 Honda Accord LXP 4 door in Metal Polish Metallic color -at invoice price. LXP version includes alloyed wheels, anti theft device, chrome tail pipe + more. Don't be afraid to ask for invoice price or less- for any auto + ask for "extras". It's a buyer's market!

I just bought this 08 Accord and I love this car. I had an 03 Civic and I am glad that I updated to the Accord. The features on this thing is excellent (nav, XM, mp3, dvd, bluetooth and great sound system) so don't test drive this car unless you want to buy it because you will fall in love.

Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14.3 hwy 25.4 @60 mile per hr>> after 3500 miles. Our Avalanche in town was 14.1 not a good trade off we drive slow and coast to stoplight,shift into neutral or turn off engine this is not a good driving experience. Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a/c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person. Numerous rattles cannot be fixed by Katy Honda, seat track broke and cannot drive for 2 weeks, VCM shudders and stays on, outside temp gauge stays at 87 degrees, map light will blind driver at night, loud road noise at hwy spd

Great car with a lot of pep! Have owned a Camry before, just switched from large SUV. Very roomy inside and the throttle response is quick! Got all features available minus nav only 10 min from work. Black with black leather with chrome trim, wing and tint just pops and looks super sharp! (HID option would be nice)

I have found the Honda Accord to be an awesome car. I have never owned a Honda before, but really have found it to be great. The room inside the car is outstanding. I am 6 ft 7in tall and have plenty of room. My family of 5 can comfortably ride in this car.

Had many issues with VCM - irritating nauseating in and out of 6-4-3 modes so noticeable that it made my wife/passenger ill. At about 3000 miles it all went away and the car is now a pleasure. There seem to be so many components that enter into the VCM that performance can vary WIDELY from car to car. I read about the former BMW owner getting 20 MPG 50/50 hwy and city. Well, I don't know how they drive but I am pretty aggressive and the worst I have gotten is 24 combined and I regularly get 30 in the highway at 75 with A/C on!

I turned in my S2000 for the Accord Coupe V6 w/ Nav and auto trans. I must say the nav is fun to play with, still getting to know all the functions and voice command. The stereo and XM radio is great. The speedo/tach is a little boring compared with the new Civics and S2000, but it's bright and legible at night. There is a faint pull when the cylinders switch from 6 down to "eco" mode, but it's very faint. Ride and handling are great as is the power, though pretty unimpressed with overall fuel economy but at least it doesn't take premium (averaging 23 mpg). But it looks hot, so for me, switching from an S2000 to this was important. People will gawk.

I have had my Accord for about a month now and I keep falling in love with it more and more. It has been a great car, and you cant beat it for the price. The nav system is amazing, bluetooth is very handy, and the styling is just perfect. However, the road noise is apparent, which i didn't really notice when we first got the car, but everything else makes up for it. This car is Front wheel drive, but you would never be able to tell by the steering. It is very smooth. If you are considering BMW and Mercedes, check this one out.

Great forum by Edmunds. Just got an Accord and no regret at all. I trade down from 2006 Acura RL and 2004 G35 Infiniti because of the Ga$ prices. I looked at Maxima almost bought one then again ga$ prices. I am glad I did because this ride is nice for 1/2 the price of RL. I like the interior space, dash-board, and a very functional cabin. I only have 200 miles on it thus far, so no complaints here. Just what I expected from a 4cyn. car and much more in style and craftsmanship. Way to go Honda!

I previously owned a 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT. Now that was a fast car but thats about it. This car is a dream from the GAS to the STYLE to the COMFORT. You will not regret your choice I PROMISE.

After having the car for 1 week I drove fro an extended period at night. The headlights and taillights flicker every 30 or so seconds when the A/C kicks in at all speeds. Not only is this very annoying but also dangerous due possible road rage from drivers thinking you are flashing them or from a trucker passing you thinking that it's clear by the flicker from the headlights not to mention problems associated with the taillights flickering. Called Dealership and while they are helpful Honda says that this is normal even though they are working on a fix. Honda has been aware of this and still no fix they say it's "normal" because all the 4cyl do this.

This is the second Honda Accord I have owned and I have had the best all around service from these cars. I will not buy anything else.

Awesome car, couldn't be happier with my purchase. Gets great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25.5 mpg. Have the car a short time and have received many complements. Would buy this car over and over again!

This Car is a Pleasure to drive from day 1. I have the diamond white pearl which is awesome with the tan interior. I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage. It's the roomiest Accord I have ever had. Its the most comfortable Accord I have had. I have only one complaint that is the Road noise that I get from this and all the accords I have owned since 1997.

I am an avid car lover. Been researching cars for over 30-yrs. I did my homework before buying this car. Looked at everything: Camry, Altima, TSX, etc. This was the best value for the money, and thought that Honda's known reliability and resale would be a benefit. Went with the top- of-the line L, paid just under 30K. After over 30K miles not so pleased with my purchase. Brakes are the worst of any car I have owned, undersized and prone to excessive wear. Had to bring back to dealer for new Routers at 10K. Check engine light has come on twice already, each time resulting in a major repair. Fuel economy in the V- 6 is nowhere near the estimate on the sticker. Getting only 22 mpg. on average.

</DOC>
<DOC>


What a nice car. Fun to drive, lots of power, smooth and a great interior. Haven't noticed any problem with the vcm as reported by some. Initial gas mileage looks good too. I do find the lumbar on the driver's seat a bit uncomfortable though. Not sure if I will get used to it in time, hope so. So far a great car, looking forward to many years of Honda reliability.

Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage. I have a V-6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage. I make a point of running in the "ECO" mode (which is car's indicator of using <6 cylinders) more often than not and drive 1/2 freeway without stop-n-go traffic, and 1/2 city on each tank - I only get 20 mpg. My BMW 530i got better mileage.

I have read the reviews. I have nothing bad to say about my car. I bought the Red Coupe 24 hours ago and I have already put 150 miles on it. I read the negativity, I have not any of those issues thus far. There is no noise when driving. There are no blind spots, just use your side mirrors correctly. The plug for my iPhone is in a great place. This is my fourth Honda and my first Accord. I had my last 1993 Honda Civic for 11 years. I was just ready for a upgrade and it was good to me until the last few years. Follow the instructions on how to buy a new car. It really help me get my car only $500 over invoice and 4.9% interest rate. I came in already financed, so I came with buying power.

Not as good as was the 2000 Accord. After 9,000 miles noise in the engine. Keyless entry not working. Don't like Honda no more no more no more

This is my first Honda. I had an old Camry and i love this new car. It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great!

Features, quality, reliability, and performance, at a price no other car maker can touch. That is why so many people keep buying Hondas, and the 2008 Accord continues that tradition. This is a very good car.

I've owned two Camrys and two Avalons and all were great cars. Never considered an Accord because they were smaller. However, 2008 Accord is bigger so I took a look. After a test drive, I was sold. The car is very comfortable, the steering is tight and precise. Similar to what you'd find in a higher priced sports sedan. The navigation system and bluetooth are great and easy to use. Between the AM-FM and XM radio, the 6 disc changer and MP3 plug- in, I have "entertainment overload". On top of this, I'm averaging 34 mpg highway. The only complaint is that there is a pronounced road noise on rough roads. Overall, best car ever. If you're thinking of buying one, just do it.

I traded in my 2006 Volkswagen 2.0 turbo Passat for my new 2008 Honda Accord. I fell in love with all the goodies. Leather, Satellite radio, sun roof, and the 17 alloy wheels. For the money it was a bargain..I got the car for $24,900. Which is about 5 thousand less for a comparable new Passat. The cabin of the Honda is roomy for two adults and three kids. The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear. I also dig the lumbar support on the drivers seat. The ride quality is smooth and quiet. And there are no rattles or noises even on rough roads. The car has a certain European look especially when viewed from the side and rear.It looks like a 5 series.

</DOC>

This is an awesome car. Even the beamers have to take a second look and usually people think that the car is an Acura at first glance. This car is top shelf and Honda stands firm by it with excellent "Mercedes" like service. Go buy it and see for yourself!

What a great car! I look forward to it every time I get to drive it. I have 2,000 mils on it in the first month. Not a single complaint. I am averaging 27 mpg mixed city/highway. Its a smooth ride. The 190 HP 4cylinder is plenty for everyday driving and passing. The car handles very well and doesn't show a difference on wet roads. I would highly recommend this car to anyone!

I have had this car for almost three weeks now and I still love it. I test drove a Camry and Altima, as well. Although the Altima has the Accord beat on styling, the Accord is the better value and will hold it's value throughout the years better than the Altima. The Camry seemed a little too much like an old lady's car! I love almost everything about this car other than the fuel economy. I was expecting better than 25 MPG. That was the main reason we traded off our SUV. I hope that it gets better as the car ages.

I have owned my Accord for about 6 weeks and am fairly satisfied with the car. A big disappointment was that the brake rotors were warped with only 125 miles on it. The dealer turned the rotors and all is OK now, but it makes me wonder if Honda's quality is slipping. These are my thoughts: Pros: Fun to drive, fairly roomy, looks good, gas mileage is OK (28 MPG combined), but not as good as Honda advertises. Cons: Most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle I have ever owned. Even though the seat is powered, it will not adjust low enough in the front to keep pressure off the back of my thighs. The seat is also very hard and becomes unbearable after a couple of hours driving.

I bought the Accord 4DR EX-L V6 without nav 3 months ago and I have been very pleased! So far, I have averaged 25-27 mpg, driving around town. Haven't taken a road trip yet, but am pretty sure it would be even better on the highway. The VCM is obviously working. It is very comfortable, easy to drive and park. LOADS of trunk space, too. Plenty of room for backseat passengers, as well. I have owned 3 other Accords before this one and this is my fav, by far. Only 2 things could make it better; memory seats and a smoother shifting transmission. I can really feel it shift gears and wasn't expecting that. Not horrible, just takes a little getting used to. 

</DOC>

I purchased the Accord Ex about 3 weeks ago & love it. I went from a mid-size suv & am happy with my decision. The car rides & handles great, with awesome power from a 4 cyl, 190 hp. Gas mileage is wonderful, 1st tank 26 mpg with almost all city driving. Looked at Camry (overpriced for the features I wanted) & Altima (no traction control, no bendable side mirrors, not as many features for the price of the Accord). Accord is very roomy. Also Honda was offering 0.9% financing! I would recommend this car for great value, comfort, & fun to drive!

After researching several sedans in this category, I zeroed in on Accord. overall I am a happy camper. In the first two weeks of my driving, I averaged around 29MPG in mixed driving conditions. not bad for a big car. I would guess around 33 in pure highway driving. The interior room is enormous. All the safety features are standard in all Accords unlike Toyota where you have to pay for some. I selected EX-L, since I wanted leather, premium audio, dual climatic control and heated mirrors. these features were once the holy grail of luxury cars. 190 HP engine is a good compromise for performance and fuel economy. My biggest gripe on this car is the road noise. Honda can do much better with this

This is my first Honda since the 90's, and I am satisfied with it so far. The only issue I have is due to a poor design in the charging system that causes the headlights to dim when the A/C cycles on. It's only for a split second, but happens about every 20 seconds in the summer-time. This is simply annoying, and makes me have some doubt as to Honda engineering's quality. The dealerships' service depts are well aware of the issue, and so far Honda has not posted a resolution. The dealers are anxious to get a bulletin for repair because it is a profit generator for the service departments! I filed this complaint with the NTHSA, so for now we'll "wait and see" if Honda makes it right.

I was very apprehensive about changing from a 4Runner to a car. I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w/o giving up power. No question the V6 is so much fun to drive. After research between the Altima coupe and the Accord. The Accord outshines the Altima in safety alone. The slalom tests that were between these two cars I would have never believed that the Accord would hug the road as best as it does. However, I am not a speed demon or a risk taker, but the sway bar is incredible. I love this car and am very happy to leave my 4runner behind.

Just traded in my 03 Toyota Highlander, which I absolutely adored to buy this Accord. I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage! My Highlander was doing the same! I traded in my beautiful Highlander for a couple of miles less than the Accord. So, for this reason, I'm sick. I traded for better mileage, and this is what I got. Eventually will trade it in for something more fuel efficient, hoping the gas prices won't make it depreciate more. I could kick myself! I miss my baby!!

We have the car 6 months. Initially the VCM was horrible - constantly hunting, vibrating, etc. much like others here and as reviewed elsewhere. MPG? Not great - around 25. At 3000 miles it all went away! Have no idea why. VCM hardly noticeable, 30 MPH HWY at 75, 26 at 80, so 75 seems to be a significant speed. Seats are firm but not uncomfortable - very BMW like. You either like them or you don't. Advise anyone considering the L to drive one for awhile if you can - some cannot stand the seats. Check the Edmunds long term test comments - they hate them. Car is now very pleasant and performing as expected. None of the squeaks, rattles or wind noise that others have complained of.

I test drove a Camry and a Sonata before deciding on the Accord 4cyl LX - P. The Sonata was not very good with the details. The seat cover was coming out in between the seats. The engine was alright. The Camry was quiet, but that was it. The interior was boring and felt like a 5 year old design. The transmission shift point was hesitant as well. The Accord felt lively, sportier and I felt fit and finish was the best. I'm averaging about 28 mpg so far on 7 fill ups. I like its looks and room as well.

Seems to be more roomier than a cambry, but not as sharp looking. Rides with comfort and motor will pick up if you need it. I purchased this vehicle with a lot of research comparing. We got 32 mpg on the highway the next day after we purchase it. It has enough room for me, my wife and my 18 year old son to go on a short trip. I am 6 foot, 225 lbs and I rode in the back seat some and had enough room. I hope I can get a few more mpg after the car breaks in some. The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats. A big person may want to think of this when shopping.

I owned this car for only a week, but I am pleasantly surprised by its performance and build quality. The 190 HP engine is more than enough power that I needed. I have compared all sedans in this category feature to feature and believe me: none of the others can match Honda Accord's price point for the same features. It gives a sporty driving feel and offers a very comfortable Highway ride. Some people complained about noise. But the fact is typical Honda has more overall noise than say a Toyota. But it is quite tolerable. In fact if you turn on your radio, you don't even feel it. I have done comparisons with similarly equipped hybrids, but I still can't justify the cost at even $5 a gallon

Purchased this vehicle after careful review of the Camry, Altima and Malibu. Uncomfortable in Camry, Had a Nissan before, rough ride. Test drove Honda and enjoyed the firm yet very comfortable ride. Fuel economy is great. Drove from Lafayette, LA to Orlando. Averaged 33.5 mi/gal. Same on trip to Houston. Overall averaging about 25-27 MPG. Handles very well, sure footed. If you like to drive and want great economy pass the other cars mentioned, this is the one you'll enjoy.

The new Accord coupe, with the V6 and manual transmission reminds me of the departed Acura CL Type-S. The Accord is a great value for the money. It's very comfortable, has pretty much every luxury feature you might want, and is still fun to drive. I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best. I've been averaging around 20 mpg with a city/highway ratio of 70/30. The suspension is definitely firm, but in no way harsh. The V6 is buttery smooth all the way to redline, and it has plenty of pull.

This is my 6th Accord and the very first that I have ever had a problem with. DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the "econo" mode the vehicle "shifts/rocks violently" forward and when leaving the "econo" mode it shifts/rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is "CONTINUOUSLY" SHAKING AND ROCKING. 5 trips to the dealer resulted in 1 new wheel, 3 new tires and rotors turned down, (3000 miles)? have produced nothing! My best MPG at 60 on cruise is 22. I have a 2006 Accord V6 and routinely get 28/29MPG and the ride is Beautiful!!! Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth! Save your money, buy a used 06

Son just graduated from college and chose this car for his first car purchase. It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats. Interior very high end, exterior very upscale look. I like the coupe style better than sedan. Having previously owned two Lexus vehicles, I think this is a comparable car at a much better price. Also, I'm impressed with all the safety features. Sound system is great too. Now I'm jealous of my son's car, maybe I'll part with my 2001 Subaru Forester and get myself a Honda!!

The value of this vehicle is great. To pay under $30,000 and get a vehicle that looks and feels like a $50,000 is right up my alley. The redesign pushed this car up a level as far as I'm concerned. I had a 2005 Accord EX and loved it but my new 2008 Accord EXL blows that car our of the water. It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size. I would absolutely recommend this car to anyone looking for an upscale sedan but cant afford to spend $40,000 - $50,000.

I bought this car on May 2008. It is nice car. I considered to get LX, but the salesman told me I had better get LX-P if I wanted to have security system and alloy wheel. I compared this car with Mazda6 and Camry. The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability. I will keep this car.

I love almost everything about this car. The look. The way it drives. Fuel economy is good (I see complaints but I get very close to EPA estimates). Very quiet (again, I've seen complaints, but for me it is quieter than any car I've ever owned). Very good power for 4 cyl. My only complaint is comfort. The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back (I am 6'3" and my wife 5'1" and we both have issues with it).

First Honda and it is no disappointment. Rides and handles very well, goes where you aim it with a very, very smooth transmission. Not what I would call exciting to drive, but very nice to drive. Interior and exterior design is attention getting. More than enough power to do what you need and lots of luxury features. Quality seems to be top notch in general. It is not broken in yet (only had it a week) and it is getting over 27 mpg combined. For me it was the best combination of price, fuel economy, power, handling and styling. Other cars in the class are kind of boring.

We have been Accord owners since 1982 and ventured outside only once for a 2004 Acura TL. After 4 years of harsh ride in the TL, we traded for an 08 Accord EXL V6 and are happy. The nice ride and handling are back, but miss the compact car the Accord once was. However, the 08 Accord is well designed, handles well for its size and the comfort level is so much better than the TL. Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable. We are getting 23 in town and 27 on the road. Honda missed the boat in not installing Bluetooth unless you spend $2000+ for NAV. Also, the headlights of the TL, which were HID, were far superior to the halogen's on the Accord.

I bought my 2008 Accord EX-L (4 Cyl) about a week ago and I absolutely love it. I am typically a GM guy and chose the Accord over the Malibu and I am sure glad I did. I am averaging about 28 MPG (City/Highway) on the first 2 tanks of gas. the ride is AWESOME and the 190 HP 4 Cyl engine is more powerful than I expected. Very pleased with my purchase!

Have owned a Civic for 10 years, but wanted more leg room(i'm 6'5")When I have my drivers seat back all the way, there is still tons of room in the backseat for tall passengers. Honda did everything right, from the exterior styling, great stock stereo and speakers, to one of my favorite features the racing "feel" steering wheel they borrowed from the Civic. The interior is laid out great,appreciate the large screen, touch controls on the steering wheel. The fit and finish are great, as with all Hondas, the buttons and switches all feel like quality, I couldn't be happier, it exceeds all my expectations, it came down to a Camry and the Accord, and it wasn't close styling wise Honda wins!

I went from a Mercedes C280 to a Honda Accord, V6 w/navigation. This car is much bigger and has all the bells and whistles. The navigation is worth the money and I love the blue tooth technology being used with my cell phone. Also, love the xm radio. I don't feel like I downgraded at all. Absolutely got a great car, roomy, comfortable, great ride for a nice price. Also, the 2.9% financing was a great deal.

I bought it on May 2008. This is my 2nd car after my '97 2D Toyota Tercel which was I bought from my friend was getting old and worn out. I was really impressed when I test drove it for the first time. It is really smooth drive. The interior and exterior are nice. I will keep this car. The gas mileage is awesome. Some reviewers were complaining about gas mileage. I don't see anything wrong it if you obey the speed limit and use cruise control on the highway. I can play my iPod because it came out with the aux jack. What I don't like from this car was the engine's emission system is very sensitive.

I got this car mid-April to replace my gas guzzling F-150 and haven't looked back since. Great amount of interior space, excellent design, the 190 hp engine takes off faster that I could have possibly hoped for (who needs a V6?), and the features that come standard with the EX are everything I could have hoped for. Fun to drive, safe, reliable, and comfortable. What more could you ask for?

I love Hondas. The best cars for the money. Only compared to Toyotas, but better Looking. I've owned two prior Hondas, a 04 Acura TSX, and a 06 Civic Si. As much as I love this brand. I hate to admit that they have loud interiors. My TSX and Si were like that but I attributed this to the low profile tires. I had heard this being an issue with all Honda models, and it is an issue with the current Accord.

</DOC>

Been relying on Hondas for 13 years. Was not going to buy another, as I am almost 50 and wanted something that was bigger and would give me a cushier ride. Read about how this one is bigger than ever, had to test ride it. Nice ride, great handling, best brakes I have ever used. Paid a little under 20k. Have 7,500 miles and no complaints. Drive for both jobs, mostly highway, activate cruise control, sit back and enjoy the ride

After driving a '99 Olds Alero for 9 years and having something break on a monthly basis, owning this car is a dream! I absolutely love it! I also looked at Camry and the new Acura TSX, but the Accord is a class above Camry in my opinion and why pay $5000 more for the TSX when it is virtually identical to the Accord? The exterior and interior is more reflective of European styling and it looks amazing. I generally keep my vehicles 8-10 years and look forward to owning this one that long.

This car lacks the performance and handling of previous years. Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city/highway after 6000 miles. Passing gear seldom works when needed. Driver's seat is not fully adjustable using 8-way power seat which is very uncomfortable. Shift- hold-control prevents coasting after hard acceleration. Reminds me of driving a boat, have to think several miles ahead if you want to do something. Car is not as nimble- footed as previous years. Daytime running lights..yuck!!! Automatic mirror dimming does not work during daylight hours and performs poorly at night.

I drove Camrys, Maximas, Altimas, and Saabs and this car is far and away the number one choice. It is loaded with so many things that make driving fun and it is retails at a reasonable price. The color choices are incredible and the car is a real head turner. In the past, I have owned some top of the line cars but this is quickly becoming my favorite. I feel this is the sleeper in 2008 and can't figure out why I don't see more of these. People who know cars will always comment favorably about the car.

Originally intended to buy an Altima but after that dealership was lame went to drive the Accord and I was sold. It's a nice, basic car and I'm pleased with the vehicle over all. Rides well and the features are nice. The only complaint I would have was that w/ my 6cyl Passport I was getting 21 mpg like clockwork and w/ this 4cyl Accord I'm getting 25.5 Something doesn't seem right with that. However, overall I'm happy with the car.

I waited until 1,000 miles to write this, but I still love the car. My experience has been nothing like what some other reviews posted. The car is solid, beautiful, comfortable, fuel efficient and big enough for my family of 5 (7,8 and 3 1/2 year olds in the back). Everyone loves the way it rides and we took it to the lake (3 1/2 hours) without a single complaint of comfort. The trunk is huge. Overall, this is a great value. I thought I would end up the Camry, but I was really disappointed in the "fun to drive" category. Pity.

This car I would well recommend to any one. It feels like you are driving a quality computer on wheels. If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage

I bought this car for 19,500 (including taxes and fees) on the road (2008 accord LX 5AT). So make sure you get the best bargain. Don't buy this car if you don't have to. I test drove Toyota Camry also. That is not any better - lack of power. The drive feels like I am driving a U- Haul truck. I just hate this car.

Having put on 178,000 miles on my 02 exl v6 accord, thought it was time to retire old Betsy, and break down to buy another. Purchased the EXL, 4cyl from a Honda dealership on Marysville OH, about 1 mile from the plant. Been reading the reviews and taken several test drives, so I knew exactly what I wanted. The 6 cyl was most attractive, but the 4 (190 hp) has enough. In fact about the same as my 02 v6. Overall, great car, a few bugs, but for the price, about as close as you can get. Smooth, quick, nimble, and quiet. Road noise is minimal, but these are Hondas, not Toyotas. Steering is excellent, and so far, on the 2nd tank of gas, I have about 315 miles, and the needle is just a under half

In trading in our Chevy Avalanche we had expectations of good fuel economy and an excellent driving experience in buying a fully loaded Accord V6. In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16-17 and highway is better at 27.4, this is driving very slow, taking off at stop lights at a snails pace, coasting to the next stop light and putting the cruise control on and running at 30 miles per hr in city. Driving 55 miles per hr between Houston and Austin this slow is very painful, boring to drv,Our Avalanche averaged 15 city with a very comfortable seat and only 20 highway but the vast majority of our driving is in the city not a good trade off. We are trading the Honda

I am a long time GM car buyer and last night I purchased my first new Honda (Accord EX-L 4 cyl) and I am just blown away with the quality. So far the car has over exceeded my expectations in every way. I was afraid I would miss my Grand Prix but that is not the case. The 190 HP 4 Cyl is plenty powerful. Very pleased with the new Accord! Way to go Honda!

Excellent car for this class vehicle. I considered Altima and Camry and have no regrets. Roomy, handles very well, good acceleration for a 4 cylinder automatic. Not a single problem with it yet, and don't expect to have many either. While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade-off. I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration. This won't be so bad once people trade in their SUVs and start driving less aggressively. Would recommend this car.

I can't believe the room. At 6'5 it is very comfortable. Ride is smooth though road noise is a little excessive. Truly enjoy and appreciate all of the features that came standard. Very satisfied after 5 months. We love to drive it and we are averaging about 28 mpg (combined city/highway).

Well I bit the bullet and traded my Chevy Tahoe. I thought I was going to cry, I loved that truck!! Until I bought my Honda Accord Coupe, I thought that I would feel claustrophobic after driving a huge SUV for almost 5 years but I didn't, it totally surprised me. I've had it 3 months and absolutely love it. The only complaint is I get 27 mpg, I'd rather have much more but I don't drive far and its almost double of what my Tahoe was. It feels and drives like a luxury auto twice the price, the handling and space for all my gadget is superb!

My wife and I are very pleased with this car. Honda really hit the mark. Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage. Oh, and a good stock stereo. What more could you ask for in a family sedan? We've owned numerous fine cars, right up to a Mercedes E55. But at this point in our life, with a new grandchild and needing room and practicality, this car fills the bill.

I bought this car a week ago and have not yet had to fill the tank. I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage. I have not yet experienced the problem with the headlights at night or the loudness of the engine (I can hardly hear it). I used to drive a Civic and absolutely love the step up. The interior is huge and the exterior is super sleek. Love it!

</DOC>
<DOC>


See my previous review 3-17-08. Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated. It is about 5 mpg less than the 2003 Honda V6 (previously owned)and about 8 mpg less than the 2006 Honda V6 (still own). Had I known what gas prices were going to do I might have opted for a more fuel efficient car.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Gets 29 mpg highway and does 0-60 in 5.9 seconds on regular unleaded! Steering is extremely accurate and allows you to feel what's going on with the road much better than Altima which had a loose and disconnected feeling. This car is bigger than i would have liked. Too bad they couldn't keep same size of previous generation accord. Seems like cars from all manufacturers are getting bigger these days though. Forgetting about size, the overall design has really grown on me. Has a chiseled look, they placed the sharp cut angles in some well chosen spots. I have had quite a few compliments from strangers. It is amazing how much room this car has though.

I bought this car with such high hopes but so far all I have is buyers regret. The interior has loud vibrating squeaking rattles coming from the glove box. Even while on a perfectly paved road the rattling noise from the glove box is so bad it drowns out the stereo and I have to drive the car with the glove box open to stop the rattle. I returned the car to the dealer and all they did was drive the car around the block and tell me there is no rattle. My guess is they don't have a clue on how to go about fixing it. Also driving over 70 mph produces loud wind noise. Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise.

I am really trying to like this car and got into a 4cyl for the value. I am now regretting my decision since this car is getting difficult to live with on a daily basis. I drive a lot. I now have 14K miles on the car which was purchased in January. I spend a lot of time with it. So here it is: The 2.4L in the EX is the nosiest engine I have ever had. Although it has good power the refinement sucks. I originally thought it was the PS pump but 2 of those later the thing is still whirring and whining. My neighbor has a Ford Fusion 4 and its significantly quieter than this engine. It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater.

</DOC>
<DOC>


My '08 Accord EXL-V6 has been reliable over the past 6 months with only a few minor rattles which were fixed by dealer(loose fog lights). Still enjoy interior and exterior styling as well as overall performance and handling. However, long-distance comfort(over 2 hours) is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply-bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle. The seat contour creates uncomfortable pressure points which quickly become tiring and downright painful.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Debated back and forth between this and the Nissan Altima Coupe. Think I made and excellent choice. The V6 is awesome, and with fairly aggressive driving (80-85 mph on freeway) and decent around town driving I am averaging about 26 mpg. The VCM cylinder technology is awesome, although you can feel it kick down to 3 cylinders when it makes the change, almost like it is changing gears. You get used to it really quick though, it took me a few days. The layout and solid build of this car great, although it could use a little more soundproofing in the wheels wells, when a rock flings up or you are driving in rain it is a little noisy. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase

Before buying the Accord, I test drove the Altima & Camry. The Camry was very comfortable, but not sporty and the ride was boring. The Altima was sporty, but I chose the Accord over it because it?s a bit larger, and the EX trim had all the options I wanted. I was planning to get the 3.5 L V-6 engine, but after test driving the 4-cylinder (190 HP), I was very content with the pickup! So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage. It?s a great car, spacious, comfortable, fun to drive, and handles very well. I would suggest opting for the body side moldings to help prevent door dings.

</DOC>
<DOC>


This is my first Honda, and I love it. The 190 hp 4cyl is much more responsive than the 177 hp. The tranny is also geared differently, as well as improved exhaust flow, and suspension over the LX(P). Torque and HP builds from Mid RPMs & up. I am averaging 28 MPG 50% highway, not broken in yet. It does have more road noise than I would expect, but other than that the car handles very well, and is fun to drive. At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1/2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking. I really like the overall appearance silver/gray, especially with the wing spoiler and tinted windows.

<DOC>


After months of research on this and other sites & countless test drives, I decided on the '08 Accord Coupe. I'm absolutely thrilled with my decision! The fit & finish would lead you to believe you're in top of the line luxury car. Definitely a head-turner, I get looks from BMW, Acura, & Lexus drivers all the time; maybe they realize they paid $10k more than they had to for a top-notch car. For people complaining about low fuel economy, are you red-lining it at every stop light or something? I drive aggressively and still get 25 MPG city. The 31 MPG hwy rating is right-on, last 2 trips I got right at 31.4 MPG. Take care of it, drive it right, and it will take care of you (& your wallet)!

I purchased this car in December of 2008 after looking at several other makes of car. After driving it for six months in the city and on the highway I have no regrets.

I recently traded my 2002 ford focus in for a Honda Accord Coupe. This car is GREAT! Everything is perfect. I just put it on the highway this weekend and its performance was amazing! I'm loving it :)

Great car, except the vcm engine, it's jerky, it will drive you crazy.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Pros: extremely comfortable, more power than camry, lots of space, good fuel economy, and mean looking Cons: i would get the V-6 model, but it has VCM which causes engine problems This car is the bomb! The dashboard is designed like Acura. It has all the features you can get on a Lexus, BMW, or a Mercedes-Benz. The Accord handles way better than a BMW . Available XM radio too!. The speakers are very good and the seven inch subwoofer is great. There's no point of getting a 7-series or an S-class or an LS. Accord has it all! I sold my 2007 Camry for the Accord. I paid more for the accord, but it's worth it.

2000 miles. 4 cyl avg 20 miles. 50/50 freeway/local. 
No doubt that it is one of best- selling car in us. Interms of riding, handling and power good. 
But "whistling noise" on acceleration (turbo charged sound kind of) too annoying. I am worry about vacuum leak. So went to dealer 3 times but no one found out its problem. 
Really loud outside noise compare to Camry. And sm trunk. 
Overall it is ok. Its previous generation was great looking and mpg.

This is my second Honda (first Accord). I love it so far. The V-6 delivers plenty of power and is very smooth. The VCM feature is great, when I see the green ECO light pop up I know that I am saving gas. Great leg room in the back and the seats a very supportive.

This is my 2nd consecutive Honda Accord, after replacing my 1992 Accord Coupe purchased in 1996, due more to size limitations of a growing family than mechanical need. The '92 was the best car I've owned in 24 years of driving. I test drove several models from Toyota, Honda, Acura, VW and Nissan. The Accord was the best in my book with the Camry running a close 2nd. We wanted a safe, functional, affordable & reliable family 4-door to haul adults and kids for a variety of activities. So far we're very satisfied. Safety ratings are very good. Ride, comfort, visibility, braking, steering and acceleration are excellent for a car of its size and price. MPG are decent for this size car.

This is our 3rd Honda Accord in the past 4 years along out of the 5 total that we have owned. It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage.

I came from a loaded Chevy Tahoe to the Accord. This is my second Honda and I am impressed by it. I bought it with splash guards and rear wing spoiler installed. The first 1/2 tank of gas yielded 25 mpg (city & hwy). Gas mileage is still getting better though. Hopefully I'll be able to consistently stay in the high 20's. It sure beats the 15.5mpg I was getting with my Tahoe. Build quality is excellent and everything is intuitive. Sure there are a lot of buttons at first but you learn to focus on what you want to change and it becomes easier with time. I don't even have to look at them much anymore, I just know which area to go to in order to change functions. Very happy with it!

I had an '98 Acura 3.0CL on which I put 175,000 miles. Since Acura no longer makes coupes, I went with the Honda because I've been spoiled. The 3.5 in the Honda is very similar to the 3.0 I had. I loved that engine and it was easy to work on so my choice was easy. So far, I love this engine too although it's different with VCM. Honda says the VCM works seamlessly but my experience is a little different. When it goes to 4 cylinders, you can't feel it. When it goes to 3, you can. When it goes back to 6, you can't feel it unless you're pulling a grade. It's not objectionable and the increase in mpg is worth it (22-23 city, 28-30 hwy). Watch out for a blind spot on the passenger side.

We leased two 2006 Accords, and we kept one and traded one for a 2008 Accord. all three of these cars were 4 cylinder models. The 2008 model acceleration from standing start is about the same as the 2006. However, the '08 has better high speed acceleration. The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models. We average between 31 and 34 on highway trips with both cars. Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased. The '08 is more comfortable and handles quite a bit better than the very good experience we had with the '06's. All three of these recent Accords have been totally satisfactory cars.

We picked up our new Accord today and all i have to say is WOW. We traded in our '04 Jetta and happy to see it go. The car drives amazing. We have looked at everything and we made the right decision with the Accord. IT could have a little bit more power, but over all its great. The Navigation is amazing. Its better than the one in our Z06, and that car is $60,000 more. It has all the features of a BMW and a lot less. I would recommend this car to anyone. There is some road noise, which many people have complained about, but the car makes up for it in everything else.

This is my first Honda and I am so impressed. The redesign is so well done. This car feels big inside, accommodates four large adults with ease. The trim package with the chrome looks so classy, I have received many compliments already. Door closure is solid, leather seats are very comfortable. I got 25 mpg around town with first tank. No Highway travel yet. I love the variable cylinder engine feature of the V6, I do notice it change but it is really not a big deal. Every control placement is well thought out, although the radio controls are somewhat redundant. I think Honda has really done well here and the added expense compared to the others in the same class is well worth it.

The 4 cyl. coupe is fun to drive, steers exactly where you aim it. The engine has very good pick up, especially from a start, and outstanding passing power from 30 mph up, gets 25 mpg. But the suspension is stiff, the car does not sway in tight turns, but you feel every bump. The interior is really noisy unless the road surface is smooth. The driver's seat is nice but restrictive, holds you in one place. The tilt steering lock is stiff and hard to set, sometimes it takes two hands to lock it in place. The radio sounds great, the air conditioning is excellent and the brakes are really positive. Overall a really nice car.

When I first purchased the Accord in the fall of 2007, I gave it a glowing review, noting that Accord had a perfect balance of quality, value and sportiness. After nearly a year of ownership, the car seems to be getting long in the tooth. Yes, it is roomy, has a nice interior, silky smooth engine, good transmission and direct steering. Yet, the Accord seems to lack that spark posessed by its predecessor. From the hard and uncomfortable driver seat, excessive body roll, several rattles in the interior and intrusive road noise, the vehicle just does not strike a chord (n.p.i) with me. In fact, I find my 2006 Civic Ex w/Nav to be a better built, more comfortable and more engaging car.

Great car so far. With the exception of the rear brakes going out at 20k.. something should be done.. My Yukon XL has 90,000 miles on it with the original brakes on the rear... 20k and need new brakes????? come on Honda... u are losing your touch

The 2008 Honda Accord Sedan EXL Navi is a great daytime driving car. You can relax and drive for hours and still feel refreshed at the end of the trip. Night driving can be dangerous though. The headlights flicker every 16 seconds, making the drive stressful and tiresome. This flickering makes it harder to focus on the obstacle head. It's important to note that this problem is common on all 2008 Honda Accords. The instrumentation is not user friendly at first but once you learn how to use the basic voice commands it becomes acceptable. It's also a good conversation subject. The Accord's interior look and feel great. Lots of room and very comfortable.

We have owned this car for almost a year now and I will not say that there isn't room for improvements (very minor room), but if you are looking for a family car that is very high quality, solid, roomy, very fun to drive, great handling and problem free there is no reason to look any further. I have owned them all Dodge, Chevy, Toyota, Ford and Hyundai and I can tell you that when new little difference exist between the brands that make a buyer go in a certain direction, but after 3 and 4 years after purchase is where the Honda shines above the rest. I've owned a 2000 civic before this and also a 2009 civic now and I can say with confidence that time make Hondas the cars other try and live up to.

I purchased this car because the amount of time I spend on the road, I need a comfortable car that is reliable. I have in the past had 4 Hondas, all have been excellent cars. My last Honda was an 05 Civic. I changed to a GM and the resale value was HORRIBLE, as well as the build quality was poor. I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value. This car is comfortable, loaded with options and every one that gets into it loves it. I imagine I will have this car for a full 5 yrs. In the past I had an 89 accord-400,000 miles out of it, a 93 civic 587,000 miles on it and an 05 civic which I sold for 2,000 less than I bought it for with 100,000 on it. LOVE HONDAS!!

Had the noise from rear brake since the first day I had it. Around 5000 miles, I visited my dealer and asked them to check it. My dealer's feedback was that it was normal and my dealer had done nothing about it. Around 22000 miles, big noise from rear brake, and when I was on the road, I got a lot of attention from other drivers. This is my fourth new Honda, after Accord 2001, CRV 2004 and Odyssey 2007, and my 2001 accord also had a lot of problems on transmission. Anyway, for my next car, I won't consider Honda anymore.

I only bought this Honda because I heard so many good things about the car. Honestly I did not have any mechanical problems with the vehicle. My opinion about it refers to fun of driving - which does not exist.The car has poor soundproofing, the engine sounds like "a washing machine in the spinning mode". This car does not give me a "sound and a feel" of the car that I am used to. Mileage - also not impressive - all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker. I will sell this car very soon.

This is the third Honda I have owned and by far the worst of the three. There has been a problem with fuel injectors going out, I have had the #4 injector replaced twice already. There is a very annoying vibration in the car at highway speeds that the dealer can not correct or identify.

I bought a Honda because I thought it would be reliable. So far the A/C system broke twice. The second time I was told that it was caused by road debris and the warranty would not cover it. I had to shell out $724 + tax. A call to American Honda was no help. It seems there are lots of Honda owners with this problem. The condenser is vulnerable to damage. I also had problems with the rear brakes. The inner pads wore out at less than 20,000 miles. They claim the caliper slider got corroded. No warranty coverage. Rear trunk lid rattles. Lots of road noise. Yes, the paint chips easily. No mirror defroster on this. The warranty is good for nothing. Anything that goes wrong is not covered.

After having driven Mercedes' and Audi's for the past couple decades, we bought an '08 Accord, and I'm here to tell you that this car drives more like a German road car than some German road cars! Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm. A power passenger's seat would be a nice addition. It's larger overall this year, so size-wise compares with an E- Class Mercedes, 5-series BMW, or A6 Audi. Price-wise it's HALF the money, with historically outstanding value- retention. Fit & finish are excellent. EPA says 31 mpg highway, and they're right. Consistent 31 mpg hwy, and up to 34.4 mpg on our last trip.

I have had the car for 3 days and I am still on the first tank. It is very nice to burn about 9 Gallons and still have half a tank after driving 260 miles. Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot. I have the full boat load, V6 EX-L, 6 Speed, Navi so on. This is my first Honda and I will be getting another. Honda nailed it on the head and it can only get better from here. This car is worth every penny of the 30K asking price.

Last week I traded in my gas guzzling 06 Ford Explorer and was searching for something A LOT better on gas which was the 4 cyl Accord. Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan (which by the way didn't think was going to have enough power and was wrong). Love the styling of the car inside and out, and I just had the windows tinted which make the car look even better. I really like the taillights and plan on putting a set of HID's in soon to really set the care off. Definitely recommended

I went from a 2004 Toyota Tacoma SR5, with a lift-kit. I usually put $35 dollars worth of gas each day, and that only got me from home to work each day. It was pretty bad. Road noise on it was horrible, and just a few weeks ago I decided to change it out for a Honda Accord. I love this car! I don't necessarily like the color, but everything else I adore. Interior is superb, exterior is very stylish. Gas mileage is perfect. I filled it up with $60 dollars and it lasted me about 450 miles. There's a lot more to say about this car but, to sum it up, it's perfect.

This is the second Accord I've owned and it won't be the last. This one replaced a 2002 Accord EX 4cyl 4A with over 140,000 miles on it that I gave to my daughter. I really liked the '02 and I really love the '08. The bigger size has taken some getting used to, but the additional horsepower compared to the '02 and the performance are like night and day. This car seems to have much more "giddy up" than the '02. I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims. I'm getting 26.5 MPG with the factory oil still in it.

I just traded in my gas guzzling SUV - it had all of the extras, but I was very impressed with the upgrades that were made to the Accord. I went with top of the line model, and the technology is excellent! The safety alone is a great reason to buy. It is solidly built and the cabin is quiet. Nice ride, and that V6 sure can kick it! I just love this car - and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee - that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment. GREAT CAR ALL AROUND!

This is my fourth car and first Honda. I have always wanted one and I am definitely not disappointed! The gas mileage is great. I averaged 31.8 MPG after my first fill-up. One can not beat that for this type and size car! I can now see why Honda owners love their vehicles so much. Once you own one you will never want to go back!

We bought the Coupe for my daughter (graduating from a Civic); My intention was to get a reliable, attractive vehicle that she would like and that my wife and I might occasionally use. What I did not expect was to start to covet the Accord. It is one of the few cars we have had that turns heads (red, black interior). Its build quality is at least equal to our last three Audi's (A6's, avant=wagon) and superior to our Subaru Outback. Because of fuel prices, I elected to get the 4; it is excellent. 190 hp and superior gas mileage. With the exception of a minor paint issue, the quality control, both aesthetic and mechanical, is first rate. Honda is a world class engineering company.

I bought this because my Mercedes died on me. My first accord, I am surprised how well it runs, and a lot of features that I had on my merz. before. plus i am now using regular octane. They are right this feels like a luxury car with the wealth of features and safety convenience.

This is a follow-up to my two previous reviews on my 2008 Honda Accord Base Model. It is the greatest automobile ever devised by man. After seven months of ownership and driving, the engine's MPG has actually gone UP from 21.2 to a current whopping 23 city, 25 when doing much highway. This isn't the sticker MPG, it's from careful recording and calc. after filling up. Your break-in period for the first 600 miles is crucial - don't gun your engine during that time. Warm up your engine for about a minute after each startup. After this coddling, you can drive like Danica Patrick at the Indy 500 and your Honda Accord will eat up the road. Good luck to all. Thank you.

I previously owned an '05 Accord coupe and was intrigued with the new design. I love this car more!! It is so fun to drive and I enjoy the new features they have added.

Very happy with our decision. Bought a 4 cyl LX-P and its beautiful. Looks like a 35 K dollar car and not a 21 K car. Solid and fun to drive and I love the room... If I was single my first choice would have been the 09 TSX from Acura. That car is amazing, but being married with a kid on the way made me make the sensible decision.

I went from a 2007 Tahoe to a Honda Accord. I sure miss my Tahoe. It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda. My Tahoe averaged 14 mpg. So far this Honda has gotten between 16.8 to 21 mpg. Seats are not very comfortable and not happy with the heated seats. They do not stay warm for long. Must say it is a great looking car, and fun to drive but not worth the little amount of gas I am saving. It has a lot of road noise, makes my eardrums vibrate.

The new Accord is the real deal. The steering is silky. The seats are very comfortable and I love the cloth.(I never owned a car w/o leather). My wife was surprised by the new body style when I brought it home. She said it looked very expensive. I got 26.5 MPG on the 1st tank of gas. Overall, this is the best car on the market in its class!

Just purchased the car on May 24th, after looking at every comparable vehicle. From Chevy to Toyota, after reading reviews from other consumers we agrees hands down, that the Accord was the way to go. The new body style looks great, and the interior is laid out very well. The safety features speak for themselves. This is the first time , after buying a car, that we haven't felt ripped off. What a good feeling, so far

This is my first Honda, it won't be my last either. It was clearly a decision made on quality and reliability. Honda screams that clearly. My decision has been 110% correct that I bought the perfect car under 30k.

I bought this car after testing several other cars in the same class. The EX-L V6 with Navi was by far the best value overall. I have no complaints so far and I have received a lot of positive comments from family and friends.

I purchased this car in January of 08'. The pros: Stunning good looks. People everywhere tell me it looks like a BMW 6 series coupe. Great pick up (V-6 Version) and good handling. User friendly interior design. Cons- Doors seem light and flimsy when you shut them. Some small, but annoying rattles when you drive. New brakes squeak when slowing down. The VCM (Variable cylinder management) seems to lurch forward when the Economy mode kicks in and out of operation. Overall a great car. It's a Honda. However, being a previous Acura TL owner, I'd cough up the extra $3-5K and get the Acura over the Honda, especially over the sedan Honda. The Honda coupe is sharp- Get the V-6 though!

I got the dark blue Accord with simonize paint and interior. The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70. Gas is over $4 a gallon in CT now! Wheels are nice, design seems like a copy from the Camry th Lexus IS the BMW 5 series the Hyundai Sonata and Hyundai Azera in the front with those sporty lights. Camry is a joke compared to this car. A dealer offered us a Camry base model for $14,999 new and the accord was about $20,500. Accord shakes less. brother in law has one, and hates it

Honda has really designed a car that I will never get tired of. She is so sharp without having to pay for the huge bucks of a Cadillac! This is my third and last Honda. I love her the most! Thank you Honda for making a beautiful and reliable car. Keep up the good work!

A smooth ride and great handling car. The car has a 268 hp engine which provides plenty of power for passing and yet the car gets 31 to 33 mpg the interior of the car is well laid out and the controls and gauges are easy to read and handle the fit and finish of the car is flawless a well built car the exterior design is smooth and flowing well done without excessive curves and as usual the Honda reliability remains its strong point I love driving this car I hate to get out of it at days end this is the first Honda I've purchased ill never drive anything other than a Honda again

I waited few months to write this review due to that I thought I will give it enough time to get used to its size. I owe a 1993 Accord that I love to drive, the 2008 is not a fun car to drive. The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear. Seats are little on the hard side.

</DOC>

Just picked up the car a week ago, and I am loving it. Before my purchase, the comparison was between the highest trim levels of the Accord, Altima 3.5 SE, Camry SE V6, and Subaru Legacy GT. This car has excellent build quality that is unmatched by any of the competition, and along with the best Navi system of the bunch, clinched the decision for me. The V6, while not as well-rounded as the competition, is very competent and has a satisfying growl to it. As for the reality check, I'm currently getting about 18.5 MPG over about 250 miles driven thus far. This is to be expected with a V6, however, as my current commute is about 2.5 miles one way to work each day.

Bought the 2008 Accord EX-L 5M after waiting 2 months for 2009 Sonata SE 5M (Hyundai would not confirm delivery). I'm getting 33-34 mpg after 800 miles of ~80% highway driving (60-65 mph). This car has plenty of acceleration for my driving style. I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips. I think the mileage would be even better with a 6-speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph.

This car has been a real pleasure to drive. After owning pick-ups, Tahoes, and Suburbans for the past couple of decades, I felt that it was time to downsize with fuel being what it is now, and I rarely ever hauled anything. Luckily, I bought this vehicle on a whim and it gets better every day. It fits right(I am 6'0"), is fun to drive, great stereo, fuel economy, performance.

Picked up slightly used Nighthawk Black V6 coupe a couple of weeks ago. So far has been great. Excellent pickup and great interior. Definitely a great buy for the price. Honda has really improved the exterior styling from the outgoing coupe. Might not be as aggressive looking as a 3-series, but definitely gets head turning. Ample room for someone that is 6'2", and extremely comfortable for my daily commute (75 miles round trip). Excellent ergonomics and attention to detail. Most of the interior layout has been carefully thought out. Great car!

</DOC>

Just passed the 5000 mile mark with about half city and half highway driving. Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy/22 city. Transmission shifting and VCM woes cited by some other buyers have smoothed out. So far, a noticeable improvement over my '98 Accord, which was a gem. Drives and handles well for a mainstream sedan, and it should be evaluated on this basis. If you want sports sedan handling and performance, then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan! Exterior with white diamond pearl resembles a BMW 525 series for thousands less.

Bought this car Dec.31 2007. Waited for five months to write this review. Have 3200 miles on the odometer. No issues. Silky smooth ride and drive. Daughter took it out and had a small ding on the right front fender. Cost $917 to fix - issue - integrated piece with headlamp. Beauty is expensive to maintain :-> Impressed by the headlamps and the interior layout. Radio buttons is a bit overwhelming. Audio quality is very good.

A lot of cabin noise. Front side pass. door panel make noise(s). Glove door panel rattles. Something in the driver panel makes a spingy noise (kinda like a PC hard drive running). Other then weird noise. everything else is pretty good. Dealer service department told me that there are other Accord 08 are having the same problem.

I have had this car for 2 months and is every thing that i need. Very peppy engine great fuel mileage 28-30 combined. I looked at the Malibu before purchase and the difference was huge. There is a great difference in the engines, gee i wonder why Honda runs 4 cyl in the INDY CARS! I am still trying to figure out the complaints on the road noise, very little that I here. Keep up the great work HONDA This is a great car!

Traded in a gas guzzling, and mechanically challenged Dodge Nitro! (had to get that off my chest) Got my Accord first week of May, never liked the old generation Accords, but this 2008 model is a welcome site. First things first: Quality: I love the way the Accord feels mechanically, and fit and finish is top grade. Performance: 190 hp 2.4 L engine has plenty of pep on highways. I haven't calculated yet, but seems to do well on very well on gas, and the steering is nice & tight! Chrysler, needs to hire Honda's engineer!(my opinion) Transmission is smooth, and I love that. It's a fun car to operate.

I recently returned my 2006 SE accord lease and this time bought a 2008 Accord. I have to say that they rally made a lot of changes, the new car is more powerful, smoother and quieter drive, lots of more options for the money, I make 30.5 mpg on hwy when not running the AC and about 28-29 when running the AC. I really like this car, all the options in the EX for 23500 out of the door..!

I have leased a BMW 5 series, an Audi A6, an Audi allroad and an Infiniti M35X since 1998 and my new Accord beats them all. It's roomy, my 4 cyl has enough power, my MPG is best ever, and its got looks. its the real package folks!

Honda's got it right! Didn't care much for my 2002 Honda, was going for a Camry till I read reviews by unsatisfied owners on this Edmund's site. Got the Honda and love it. Great looks, great pickup. Bye Bye Camry (I had a good one before my 2002 Honda). I'll stay with Honda as long as they make cars as good as this 2008. Get one...you'll like it. Gosh, Honda ought to pay me for this!

An extremely comfortable and capable sedan. I went for comfort over performance to fit it in my budget so the EX-L with the 4 cyl engine. I don't miss the V6. More than enough power for getting on the highway and passing when needed. Plenty of room in the front seat for my large frame and plenty of room behind me for a 6 foot son to sit. The black leather seats feel a bit hot on the back in the warm weather but otherwise no complaints about the interior. The exterior is handsome and gets positive comments and the Accord no longer looks like a generic sedan. I'm getting 25-26 mpg mostly highway. I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage.

Previously sold on Honda's Reliability with a '94 Honda Accord EX 4 cylinder M tran with 33-36 mpg on the highway (synthetic Mobil 1 lubricant since 90K miles), the car had 188K miles before it was stolen. 2008 Accord V-6 4 DR is a refined mid size sedan and adds more power, room, safety, and features-to-cost value. Accelr8n is comparable and exceeds BMW 5 series. Build quality is exceptional. Ride quality is smoother with stiffer suspension on V-6 than 4 cyl . 5 speed auto tran SEAMLESS.

This easily is one of the best cars on the market. It isn't a old man's car like the Camry, has better features for less money than the Altima, and isn't a rental car like the Malibu. The residual value on a Honda is above the rest, and the fit and finish is spectacular. You will read bad reviews here and there, but not every car off every line is perfect. To the folks who don't like your Accord, you must not have wanted it that bad and met a good salesman. I can talk all day about how good the car is, and if you don't believe me then go drive one! you'll take it home unless you're too upside down in your American Vehicle with no value! The 2.4 doesn't have the power of the V6 but still flies!

We bought this car with the expectations of getting a car that feels good with my bad back, gets good gas mileage, and is reliable. So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable on my back, and the gas mileage has been pretty good. It feels well-built, and the VCT does work seamlessly as advertised. I appreciate the iPod jack, but it would be nice if it were more conveniently placed, and had more interaction capabilities. I would like to be able to get Bluetooth without buying the nav system. Final issue - the transmission seems to downshift a little rough, especially between 35 - 40 mph. This may get better as the vehicle gets broken in; I only have 1200 miles on it.

I love that Honda decided to get with the times and update the look of the 08' Accord but it's obvious that they didn't do enough research in to what consumers really want and need in a 25- 30k car. I had the 07' Camry XLE and like my accord more.

After much review of 4 door sedans in the $30K price range I went with the Accord. I'm only 100 miles into my driving experience, but have to say that I love this car. It has a very upscale exterior design. The build feels and is very solid. The doors close like a Mercedes. The seems are very tight. As far as handling, the best was I can put it is that it is very confident. The braking and acceleration are excellent. The interior design is roomy and very comfortable. The control counsel and sound system do a very solid job. You could pay $20K more for a luxury sedan. But why?

</DOC>

Does everything well. Sharp looking car at a reasonable price. Getting over 27 mpg in mostly highway use. Steering nice and tight, seats a little stiff but comfortable. Interior is very roomy, and I can sit comfortably in the rear seat at 6'2". Good trunk space, nice finish and materials in both the interior and exterior. Smooth ride, Have not noticed any excessive road noise on the highway as described by other buyers. Plenty of acceleration in the 190 hp version. Typical Honda, does many things well.

Paid $20,500 before tax for LXP model. Great car, really comfortable and quiet. No problem so far. One complaint , I can never get to around 31 mpg on highway. The best I can get on the highway is around 27 mpg

This is my retirement car. Had a VW and was looking at another. Had issues with repairs and too many people were talking about reliability issues for the new ones also. Moving into a fixed income decided on a Honda. Many people told me of stories where all they spent was on gas, tires and oil. Soon to be on a fixed income just what we needed. It is great to drive, has many nice features and gets you there with great mileage.

I have been driving Accords trouble free since my 1st 1985 Accord 2Dr hatchback (210k miles) and this is my 3rd Accord. I wanted to get away from the "family sedan" look of my 2001 Accord (172k miles) so I bought the coupe and gave the 2001 to my daughter who needed a car after her 1998 Camry engine seized (oil pump). I really like the styling of the coupe. The car is not noisy as some previous reviews mention but I don?t have the sun roof or the V6 which may add noise. From the start I have been getting about 31 MPG (2/3 Hwy driving) which is better than I got with the 2001 4cyl 5M sedan (maybe better aerodynamics with the coupe). Since I commute 80 miles/day this was a pleasant surprise

Owned a 1980 Civic DX, 1983 Accord Hatch LX, 1989 Accord Sedan, 1997 CRV, 2002 CR-V EX...and now, 2008 Accord EX Coupe 4Cyl AT. This coupe is the nicest of the bunch! It's a well built beauty. Solid build, comfortable interior, smooth ride, fuel efficient (averaging 27.9 mpg, reasonable price and, it's a real head turner. I simply love it!

I like it. I really like it! I have to say that this is my 5th Accord and I am hooked on them. My 98 got totaled so I went for this. The Avalon's design is prettier inside out but the engine is same size so I said y not? The ride is good, the sound system is more than adequate and it handles excellently. Once again, I like it. There's nothing else to say.

This car is just plain "Awesome." I traded a 2003 G35 Coupe for this vehicle. I had some reservations about unloading my dream car, but it was well worth the trade. With the voice activated navigational system makes it even more of a luxury car than a sport vehicle. The handling, horsepower and smooth lines inside make it a dream to drive. Not a bad vehicle after all and we worth the investment. This vehicle turns head when driving down the highway and I am proud to be behind the wheel. Great Car!

This is my second Accord and it's bigger, zippier and more comfortable. I finally found a sedan with a sunroof frame that doesn't hit my head. Mileage is very good and we have already taken it on a long trip. Finding a good seat position was easy. Navigation complexity is overblown if you are good with computers or other digital gadgetry. It took a couple of weeks - and assiduous reading of the manuals - to get the technology down. Lots of cubby holes and we like the MP3 player connection. The 17 inch Michelin Pilots provide a smooth ride and good corner traction.

Enjoy the way the car handles especially the power of the V-6. I think Honda made a big improvement in the design of the car. The Vcm systems totally ruins the car. What a big disappointment. I had rather not have it and sacrifice the mileage....

I purchased a new Accord about one month ago. I have put close to 2000 miles on it so far. The gas mileage has been as advertised, hitting 32 mpg on the highway when driving at 65 MPH. I believe I have found the best of both worlds with engine-response, and decent fuel efficiency. This car is stylish and very comfortable to drive. I previously drove a '99 Avalon which is still going strong at 170K miles. I hope to have this one that long as well.

This my second Honda, had a '90 Prelude Si, have to say Honda has certainly increased the fun factor! My coupe is the 6 speed manual, have had two bad experiences with 6 speed autos in other brands, (test drove the Accord EX-L V-6 with the 5 speed auto, was not impressed, decided to get the 6 speed and shift myself, great decision. This thing will fly low, was amazed at the power and response, handles great, wouldn't know that it's FWD unless you push it past it's limits. Gas mileage after 1000 miles is averaging apprx 23- 24 mpg in a blend of city/highway. A 75 mile freeway trip at 65 mph in sixth gear produced 28.4 which is above what Honda indicated. All around so far great vehicle..

I have this car in Nighthawk Black Pearl and it turns heads everywhere. People tend to think it's a Lexus for some reason and are shocked to learn it's an Accord. The fit and finish are wonderful, it's obvious a lot of thought went into it. It's a "large" small car, too. My friends say the ride in the back is not bad at all.

Have you ever bought a car just because of the name? Well I did and it was the biggest mistake. I am trying to find a dealership that will take it back. For over 25,000 I expected perfection. The sound of the road is so loud that I can barely hear anyone on the phone. The air doesn't blow as cool when I press the gas. I have to open the door wide just to get out of it without hitting side and I am only 115 lbs. The blind spots are out of this world. I am beyond displeased with Honda. Yes, maybe past models were better, but they have truly ruined their brand in my opinion with this car. Yes, it looks great, but that is about it. I should have stayed in my Altima! Take my word...don't buy!!

Dealer was ok. I bought the 2008 Accord 4 DR EXL-V6. Wind noise on the road. Gas mileage is the pits. I do not do jack rabbit starts and I use the cruise on the highway. The interior and exterior are nice. I miss my keyless numbers to open the door when locked. It has everything but good gas mileage. It has some blind spots and the front sets so low you have to be care when you park in the parking lot it will drag on the curb.

Very comfortable and roomy vehicle. Interior layout excellent. Exterior looks excellent. Fuel economy excellent for such a large car. It is a 4 cylinder so does not have the power I am used to because I have been used to V6 & V8 engines. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a new car of this size. I hope Honda's reliability holds out. That was one of the major reasons for my purchase of this car.

I get a new car about every four years and this is my first Honda. My last three were a Camry a Maxima and a Audi. I waited for 3000 miles to really get a feel for this car before writing this review. With gas getting to 3.50 a gallon I figured I would go for a four banger instead of a six and I am not sorry. This car (big for a 4) has plenty of punch at 190 horses. Getting about 26-27 in mixed driving. The ride is firm but not harsh, It is more comfortable than the Maxima and looks much better than any Camry. Road noise is a little loud, but with a 270 watt stereo who cares! Looks good, rides good, has all the bells and whistles, and Honda dependable, what more can ask for under $25G.

I just traded in My Suburban 2007 LT for the Accord. The inside of the Honda is a bit disappointing to me because it is cheap looking, it reminds me of Honda's I drove in the late 80's and 90's. I previously owned a Chrysler 300 2006, so it is difficult going from a real comfortable interior, really massive dash to a bland and old fashioned interior. My husband really wanted the Accord. Of course we didn't like putting over $100.00 worth of gas into the truck. My accord doesn't run smoothly, you can feel every bump and hear it loudly. Exterior looks good. I have over 6 foot tall boys (13,15) the leg room is barely enough. If you get migraines like me the gauge lights are bright white Yuk!

I traded my 2004 Chevrolet Corvette for a new 2008 Honda Accord Coupe V6 and I am totally happy. This car has great gas mileage even with the V6. It's much more comfortable than the Vette and I absolutely love driving it. It has great handling and does so with comfort. I researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000. HONDA, YOU GET AN A+! Thanks

Update at 11k miles: Bought the car in October - In December had the overhead cams, rocker arm, fuel injectors and battery all replaced - dealership claiming bad gas (no reports to prove it). In February took the car in for an oil leak. In March had the right front rim/tire replaced because of pothole - had car realigned and balanced - still vibrates between 60-70 mph till date. Currently the rubber door seal if falling off. The best gas mileage I can get is 22 mpg which is mostly highway and the car sometimes hesitates during acceleration

I have the new Accord with all the bells and whistles and what a let down! The cellular system can not do what a Ford Focus does these days - automatically synch a phone book on ANY bluetooth phone, voice dial through the car using the phones voice recognition (Ford, BMW, Lexus, all do!) AND who in their right mind created a car that holds data you can not back-up? There is a CR reader, why not CR-RW- or a place for a chip in the dashboard? It has TWO phone books, the nav system and cellular, and they don't even synch! AND to add insult to injury they have a jack for your iPod but again it is a BASIC audio in - no tunes synching (again a Ford basic) and no display on your dashboard.

We have owned many Hondas and so I trusted this one to be up to par. Not as powerful as is claimed. Not as good of gas mileage. This vehicle is noisy. The worst part is the headrests, which Honda is proud of. They lean forward and do not allow you to lean your head back or straight up. The curvature of the seat is slouchy. Overall very dissatisfied and wondering how to get out of my lease.

Incredibly fun vehicle to drive. I used to drive an RSX and with my new Accord I don't miss it one bit. Great acceleration, handles turns really well and feels rock solid. Interior is nice. The model came standard with most features that I liked like satellite radio, leather, chrome handles, etc...

Drives and Handles great! Don't think you need the V-6 Model for power. The Vtech I-4 190 hp is more that enough to get the car moving!! Steering is very tight which is great on a small car. The looks of the car itself turns heads, every time we go somewhere, someone is always looking....Overall i think you will not regret buying this Honda

Recently bought the Accord after a falling tree totaled out my 2004 Maxima. Looked at all cars around the price range. I drive around 60 miles a day so fuel mileage was important.Was on the way to see a Toyota but stopped at Honda first.Took a test drive, looked at the one in the showroom and we were sold. Wife and I both commented on how solid it felt. Great interior room, Great safety features, and a great deal.We bought the one in the showroom. First tank mileage was 27 mpg not bad at all. Average has been about 26 to 27 mpg

Looked at E 350 MB and Acura RL's both very nice cars. The Acura comes loaded but is made by Honda so we figured to try the Honda Accord v6. It didn't have as much luxury inside but the car was hard to beat. What a GREAT car! My first Honda and so much fun to drive. Loaded with Deep tinted windows, black leather w nickel trim, sweet. Outside is Polished metal. Really great with Tinted windows. Navigation system is WELL worth the money. It is so powerful and takes you anywhere. Blue tooth was very easy to pair with the car and talking on the phone in the car is great. Everyone hears well and it is a surreal feeling. The car is so cool. I cant say there is anything I don't like about this car.

I have been driving my new Polished Metal Metallic 2008 V6 EXL with Navi and Bluetooth. It all works great. The car looks great and handles really well. The VCM technology seems flawless. Everything is extremely well engineered and designed from the interior to the exterior to the engine compartment, etc. Nothing has been overlooked. Nobody builds cars, suspensions or engines like Honda. I think the controls for the navi, HVAC, awesome sounding radio, etc. are well thought out and intuitive - I do not agree with the criticism.

I have always been a gm person, but I gave Honda a try, which was a gigantic mistake. It wouldn't even start on the second day, it had Major airbag problems and transmission problems. The build quality is also terrible, the front fender fell off at 4,500 miles (I didn't even go over any bumps) I need my car for work driving on the highway, and this Honda has broken down on me twice while cruising at 65 mph. This all happened in about a 5 month period, I ended filing a lemon law suit, got my money back and bought a better car since the end of February, I've been driving a new Chevy impala ls (base model) and it has not given me a single problem please, if your buying a car, don't buy a Honda!

This is the first Honda I've owned. What a great car! I had to wait month before they could find 6 seed manual in blue. It was worth the wait! The car is a real head turner. Fit and finish are a1. Performance is outstanding, more like a sports car than a coupe. I thought about a mustang gt but went with Honda because of gas prices reputation. I'm not disappointed.

Bought a new LXP 2 weeks ago. Paid $20.5k with destination and no extras. No complaints. wanted a low maintenance vehicle (no headaches). hard to beat the Honda track record in the price range. Cruises nicely on highway at 70/75. highway mileage slightly over 30 as advertised. mixed driving around 27 mpg. Decent acceleration on the highway for a 4cy. with gas prices, wanted better mileage. stereo much better than my 2004 odyssey. in price range, hard to beat the 08 accord.

I've owned several Accords and this one has more power and refinement, and is the largest version I've owned. Lots of power with the 6 spd, and the car has a great balance of style, performance, and (so far) reliability. Highly recommend the V6 coupe with the manual transmission.

This is my first Accord and I think it is a great value. I have had other Hondas - the old Prelude and the Acura Legend. They were all very reliable as I expect this one to be. This Accord drives like my old Prelude and is quite fun to drive. It is noisier than my Lexus LX but not more so than my Town and Country Limited or my old Mercedes E. It gets good mileage on HWY = 30 but mediocre on local = 21. Everything else is great in the car for the amount of money paid.

I have owned many north American cars and several vw's. Some were fun to drive but none of them was immune to requiring several ongoing repairs. Nearing retirement and after listening to many honda owners, I bought one. Have to say the comfort, look, design and how it drives is first rate. We wanted three things, heated seats and mirrors and an easy to get out of back seat for some aging friends. Back seat comfort and entry/exit are great. Very pleased and would buy another.

My family has had over 30 hondas since the 70's. Replace a battery, replace timing chain at 60k plus, everything else is great. The '08 Accord I believe is the best of the lot. Read various reviews and I'm surprised. No problem with quality, performance, etc. Got 30 mpg, with a/c off at 70 mph. Average 24-26 daily. Ride is superior, comfortable seats, radio excellent. Don't have navi, I'll buy a portable unit. Very surprised at comments relating to reliability and service problems, never had such problem with any of the hondas we've owned. Remember, when you sell this vehicle you'll always get top price...

I am very disappointed in this car. I am disappointed in the ride. The VCM is very rough. It lunges when shifting. The brakes have squeaked since purchase and the dealer can't hear the noise so say they can't fix it. I was told that the reason they squeak is because Honda uses hard disc pads so they will last longer and problem with brake pads is a reasonable swap for longevity. Not to me.There are more rattles than I would like but this isn't too bad. I had SAABs for 16 years, one a 4 cylinder and the other a V6 Turbo and wish that I had bought another one even though they cost more to fix and maintain. The SAAB dealership has treated me far better than the Honda dealer.

I bought this 2008 Honda Accord EX V6 and it's the best car I've ever owned. I traded in my 2006 Lexus gs 300 to get this beuty. This 2008 accord is far more smoother, extremely powerful, quieter and reliable than lexus. I have 11,000 miles on my accord and trouble free. Who said Toyota products are reliable? i had to replace the transmission of the lexus at 8,500 miles. I am now going to have a solid reliable car for 10-15 years (2008 honda accord) Thanks Honda for making top class cars. I also have an Acura mdx which is also excellent.

Traded in a a 2007 6 Cyl. SUV, wanted something with better gas mileage and something that had good resale value. Used edmunds and the dealership came in $800 under invoice. Not sure what invoice even means anymore. At first they said they couldn't go any lower than $75 over invoice but as I was about to walk away from the deal they lowered it.

Fun to drive! My first Honda. Precisely tuned suspension that hugs the contours and curves. Beautiful sleek new exterior that says "Come Look At Me"!!! I'm looking forward to driving this car every day I get up and head out!! It's that much fun. Nicer interior than the Mercedes C300's we looked at.

After researching and driving many different vehicles, we choose the Honda Accord V-6 4 door sedan. Why? Because is has the perfect balance of the things we were looking for without sacrificing any one feature. The 4- door provides the room we needed, the exterior design keeps the "sedan" from looking boring, the gas mileage is great, the price point was right, and the reliability is terrific. We are thrilled with our new car. Kudos to Honda - they got this one right!

Have this one since Nov-2007. Went to LA three times, able to drive 95 mph on tight corner for speed limit 55mph. Wish to upgrade to 19" wheels. Gas mileage is disappointed, avg 20 mpg so far. Noise level is too high for $30K car. Honda engineers must solve this problem ASAP. Get rid of cylinder deactivation on coupe, it actually slows down when try to accelerate. Driving and handling are top of the class (Altima is very close competitor). No live traffic on its navi (Altima has that feature, but resale value is horrible for Nissan products). Fit and Finish are excellent

i just purchased my lx-p a couple of weeks ago, having driven a pick up for the last 25 years, i was really surprised at how much i like this car, going from a big v-8 to a 4 is a change but the power is good, gas mileage is great. my first fill up was 26 mpg mixed city and hwy I only expect it to get better, steering is tight and precise, only complaints are road noise is more than i like but its livable, rain or just dew pours in right on top of the power window controls when the window is cracked, but window guards have fixed that, its a fun car to drive, and for what it is, its comfortable, controls are great, easy to reach, I'm looking forward to a lot of great miles with this car

I bought this car because of the reviews. I had a problem with the navigation from the first week. It freezes and will will back out "dial- in" options, not very handy when you are lost. I need to shut off the car to get it to correct itself.

I expected to be buying a value-family sedan, but instead I got a great- driving, leather-comfy driving car. It drives better than the 2002 A4 1.8T I replaced. The auto-transmission is quite sporty and 4 cylinder engine is more than enough power. It even has the auto-dimming rear-view mirror.

This is the third Honda in a row for me, and it looks like I will be buying a fourth. The new Accord has a lot more power, style, and room than my 2001. The look is that of a BMW or Acura TL, but for way less money. My daughter has been telling everyone that it is her car, but that we can drive it until she turns 16 in 5 years.

I have had this car for about 4 months now and i must say that overall it's one of the best cars I have owned. At first the gas mileage was a disappointment, but as the car is now breaking in (3800 miles) it's getting better. As of this morning when i filled the tank i got 28.7 MPG and that was a mixture of highway and city driving. As far as style is concerned, it's a real attention getter and i get many compliments on it. My only complaint is that it seems a bit sluggish. I figured 190 HP would have had more punch to it, but maybe this will get better as it breaks in more.

Accord sedan Lx-P (cyl.) 5speed auto I went to test drive the 2008 civic EX . They didn't have it in black the salesman suggested the Accord they met my offer. I test the car and was very impressed with the looks and the 4cyl was adequate since gas mileage was very important to me.other car was Accura TL/Lincoln LS V8. I expected a little better gas mileage avg, approx 26 mpg. not bad on 70% highway driving and 30% city.1100 miles now . I would highly recommend to friends

My wife has a '08 Camry Hybrid. Very cool instrumentation. Very nice ride. Bought '08 Honda EX and a bit disappointed. Road noise more than Camry on anything other than smooth highway. Heated side mirrors but no compass or outside temp indicator. Go figure!In Tenn we need the later more than the heated mirrors. Aux outlet is in center console and awkward to get to, especially if you have a bunch of junk in console. Power outlets turn off when you turn off the car.Can't charge my cell phone unless I'm driving. No auto headlight on/off! Trunk layout is a strange. Much more narrow and 1 cu ft smaller than Camry LE. Comparing Hybrid w/Honda EX probably not fair comparison but is vs the LE.

This is my first Honda and my first new car. I'm coming from driving a 12 year- old Camry. Everything I read about the Accord was that it is louder, road noise-wise, than the Camry. That's an understatement. I figured that going from a '96 Camry to an '08 Accord I'd have a quieter car, but I was wrong. I've read that you can get tires that are quieter, so eventually I may do that. But for now, I'll just turn up the stereo. The car is fun to drive on back roads and cruises smoothly on the highways. It feels solid and I feel safe in it.

New Accord purchased from Honda West in Las Vegas. There is a major problem with it! I've had it for 5 days and it needs a two day major service! The service adviser said it will be TAKEN APART in order resolve the problem. The dealership has not been responsive thus far. Since they lied to me when they tricked me into taking possession of the car (they said the issue was no big deal-easy fix), I'm surprised. I've had two other Accords. It might be that every 1 out of 3 are lemons? Beware of the 08 Accord and Honda West if you live in Vegas!

I just turned in my 05 Malibu for the Accord and what a major difference, should of gotten the 05 Accord when I had the chance. Ride is excellent and secure, power is good. One thing I will say to everyone who gets a car: do your home work. If you had read some of the car or consumer report write ups about the car a lot of your concerns I was reading about would have been answered, i.e. poor gas mileage look close at your window sticker not the big mpg numbers but the ratings below, it tells you that you could get 17 mpg based on your driving habits. Next time you take a new car for a ride tell the sales man not to say a word and keep the radio off and find a road that needs work to drive on.

I have just purchased this vehicle, and am impressed with the power of the 4-cylinder engine with the automatic transmission. The ride is excellent, and the fuel mileage is impressive so far. My first tank of fuel I experienced an average of 29.2. I do mostly highway driving, but was very happy with the early numbers

</DOC>
<DOC>


All I can say is stay away from this vehicle. 
1) Road noise= Loud 
2) Vehicle Ride= Very bumpy. 
3) Headlights= DIM. For your safety, do not drive this car at night on back roads. 
4) Gas Mileage= Poor. 20 - 21 mpg no matter what the driving conditions, even with cruise control on the highway. 
5) Seats= Like sitting on a church pew. 
6) Rattles,Rattles and Rattles again 
7) Horrible wind noise 
OK, now some positive things: Will be happy when I get rid of it!!!

Started looking at sedans after a Pilot I've had for 3 years. Wanted something with better handling and gas mileage. I also drove the Camry but they did not offer a higher-output 4 cylinder than the Accord. The EX has a tighter suspension and handling feel than the Camry. Overall a terrific car, one I hope to keep for 5+ years.

Bought it 4 months ago and quickly discovered that I bought a piece of JUNK. Leather seats are the only thing of good quality. Any other thing is just JUNK. I think Honda is using recycled plastics for the dash. I completely disagree with experts saying that the new Honda Accord's interior is of good quality. What good quality they are talking about. Everything inside the car rattles on very fine bumps and normal roughness on the roads. This gets me mad. What a poor quality. The car has wheel imbalance, which the dealer has never been able to fix! Can you believe it? Honda cannot get a balanced car out of their factory? The suspension is very poor. The body is very loose.

I was so happy when I first got my new accord. Soon after I bought it, I started experiencing some issues. First my remote didn't want to work most of the time. Then even when I didn't press on the gas it would start gassing while I was in park. Then I had to replace my rear brake pads. I have kept up with my service but when I start the car it makes a rattling noise. I owned a 94 Honda accord before this and I was never disappointed. Wondering if I should just trade the car in to protect my family.

We have owned Accords since 1983, all have been great cars. I have bought 9 Honda's since 2005. But like everyone else, the rear brakes are a real headache. Numerous problems with rotors and pads and dragging the parking brake. 97% of our miles are interstate, so we don't use brakes much, I can't imagine how many problems I would have if we urban commuted. Honda has been stonewalling the brake problem for months, if you are out of warranty, too bad. Even if you have had repairs under warranty that didn't fix the car right. They just don't care.

I just got back from a 3000 mile road trip from California to Sandpoint Idaho. The Honda was very comfortable to drive and averaged 32.5 miles per gallon. I have the v6 - manual sticker said 25 hwy, 22 in town... I get 27 in town. This car is the best I have ever owned.

Great car but rear brakes went after one year! I called the dealer and they would not cover it. My mechanic could not believe the brakes had to be replaced. He actually bet me money it was not my brakes, he lost!

2nd set of brakes at 50,000 miles. NEVER ever had this problem with any car I owned, let alone Accords. No change in driving habits. At $700+ a brake job, it adds up. Miss my 2004 Accord. Sold with 200,000 miles 1.5 years ago and I still see it around town. At year end, I'll look at the Lexus.

Had the car a year. Great gas mileage for a v-6. Terrible rattle in a/c- heater area, sounds like a Ping-Pong ball bouncing around inside when a/c is on. Noticed it a couple months after buying & after several trips to dealer, they duplicated noise and replaced heater sub-assembly. Noise went away, until couple weeks ago and it's back. Very annoying. Hoping to hear from someone experiencing same problem - looking for help.

Right from the start, I began having problems. The driver's seat does not adjust properly and the factory and dealership would not change it which gave me lots of back aches. Gas mileage is horrible on highway at 21 mpg. Driver's seat does not go back far enough. Engine performance is very lacking. This car has the 6-4-3 eco system. Do not buy it. When gas pedal is floored abruptly, the engine pauses for several seconds then slowly gains speed. The transmission does not downshift properly... If you're in drive and you decide to floor the gas pedal at 10 mph, the transmission stays in 3rd gear and does not shift lower unless you do it manually. Will not buy another Honda unless changes.

Purchased our Accord without any hesitation as we have had a 94 Accord for many years (still have it) and our sons have Odysseys and a Pilot. The main problem we encountered with the 08 model was ROAD NOISE. Exterior noise from trucks, motorcycles, construction equipment on the highway and the constant whining of the tires on the interstate. The noise problem has reached a point now where we are getting ready to trade in the Accord for another brand of vehicle. Driving on the highway, at highway speeds, with the windows rolled up and the a/c running sounds like we have all four windows rolled down.

The good news, for the money, tough to beat. Lots of features, very good engines, excellent transmission, steady handling, tons of room, and still, very reliable. My mileage, is averaging about 28.5 mpg city/hwy combined. On the highway, I got as high as 32 mpg, and I drive somewhere between 75 and 80. However, like so many reviews, I too, have had a brake problem. Had to have the rotors turned at 25,000 miles, but that was it. Also road noise. Honda should've, not could've, made this more quiet, but still not as terrible as described by so many others.

I have almost 19,000 miles on my car (got it Apr 2008) and I have had none of the problems mentioned on here. My brakes are fine. I do use the parking brake often as I also heard that it aligns your brakes properly as another poster mentioned. The leather seat is not the most comfortable, but not bad. I drove from Chicago to Cleveland with no stops and I was fine (I am 6'3"). I got 29+ mpg on that trip, so I don't know what Edmunds is saying that they can't re-create the 29 mpg highway number. I average around 26-27 mpg (mostly highway). Acceleration not the most responsive, but once you drive it for awhile you know how to get it going.

Overall, I am pleased with this automobile. It would be nice if the passenger front seat were available with the electric controls. Front passenger seat is quite low. I have also noticed a whine in the transmission. This noise is not really loud but it is noticeable through each gear. I did take it to a Honda dealer and they said this was normal. I have owned other Hondas and Toyotas and neither of them had this noise during shifting. Thank You

Bought car last month fully loaded without Nav. Took it back to the dealer after a week due to a loud knocking noise when driving. Dealer did not know what the problem was until after 3 business days. Service bulletin out for inadequate torquing of the rocker arm bolts. Loaner car provided by Dealer but still in shop waiting for the balance parts. It has been in the shop for 1 1/2 weeks. Very disappointed with this issue. I did also notice poor shifting in first gear and surging between cylinder changes. I also had wind noise coming through the moon roof while driving. I hope all the repairs will be completed when I pick up the car early next week. I have been very disappointed.

An Accord isn?t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets, namely performance, but sadly to say, in others, it surpasses. The 4 cylinder lacks performance and handling and the gas saving is only minimal. Option for the V6 if it is an option for you. I drive 140 miles daily, and found the comfort the best feature. The controls are logic and easy to use. I did notice the traction control is something lacking at times. What you are getting, most of all, is Honda?s reliable. Something BMW still struggles with.

Driving this car is like going to heaven. You will want for nothing. It is amazing in every way. It has bells and whistles I never knew it had. The car is human and perfectionistic. It drives well, the satellite radio is awesome and it has the comfort of home. I am thinking about living in my car.

Really nice car to drive. My second Accord , and very happy with it. I was a bit disappointed with the 4 Cyl mileage as I drive over a 100 miles a day round trip to work. I did find something very interesting: On the EX- L Navi the vehicle comes with "Auto- Climate Control" and the air conditioning compressor cycles all the time; winter or summer. There seems to be no way to shut it off and mileage is about 26/27 highway. It can be shut- off in cold or cool weather with the voice command "air conditioning off". Mileage jumps on the highway to 31/32 at normal speeds. MUCH BETTER!!! In the summer turn it back on with "air- conditioning on" Other than that - very nice car and great build quality.

This is my first Honda purchase. And I am very disappointed in the car I bought. For this kind of money, you can get a luxury vehicle with way fewer problems. First servicing took a whole day (so many problems) and still had to take it back. Problems with steering wheel, windows & seals, seats (electric and heater). It is a loud car.

When my car suddenly broke, my first thought was a Toyota, but found out that they were too small. Next I saw a Camry, but wasn't smooth enough. I looked at the accord, and fell in love with it. My son liked the ex-l the best, but that was out of our budget. He wanted the ex for the sunroof at least, but that wasn't necessary for us. We went with the LX-P because of the rims. The car is very smooth for a v4, my first, but I thought that the gas mileage should be More about 38-45. Well I guess we cant have everything. The car is great, both with styling and performance. This is my first Japanese car, and so far so good! I would definitely recommend this car to any body, any age

Car is a rocket with the 268 HP 3.5 liter V6, though not great on fuel, 21 mpg. Fit and finish is near perfect. If I could I would have the cylinder management system disconnected. I can feel the engine kicking off cylinders which is my only annoyance with the car. The dash controls are a little fussy and is taking some time to get use to, but nothing like a friends very very fussy Audi.

I was driving a MB, but it was always in the shop. It also was getting only 13 Miles per gal. I bought it new in 2000, but consider my new accord an upgrade.

Compared to the '00 LX-V6-A4 and '03 EX- I4-M5, the LXP-I4-A5 is not as quiet or smooth riding. I would rate the new LXP being very good overall instead of excellent. Even though the chassis is supposed to more rigid, LXP makes loud popping/cracking sound when going over bumps, especially when car is cold. Lean back hard on the driver seat back would occasionally result in a cheap spring popping noise. Even after 3,000 miles, I feel a strong downshift deceleration during first cold shift from 1st to 2nd gear. Stepping trans selector from park through 1-2-D seemed to help eliminate this harsh shift. Hood failed to latch completely on first day home. Need to get trunk lid hinge squeaks fixed.

I traded in my ultra-reliable 1998 Accord that had 153k miles for the 2008 EX-L 4-cyl. I absolutely love the car! Handles great, awesome fresh interior, lots of cool new features. I've fueled up once and got about 24 mpg - Not great, but I've been told it gets better. The engine is a very peppy VTEC - it really kicks in at about 3500 rpms. Very impressed with the 4-cyl. Also, amazing leg space in front AND back seats - the Accord could almost be considered a full size sedan. Honda has done an amazing job with this design. I love it!

I traded in my 2004 Infiniti G-35 coupe because it was a lemon - I'll never buy Nissan again. I have heard about Honda's and Toyota's lasting forever so I settled on the Accord Coupe - as the Solara is unappealing. I have to tell you, in driving the Accord, the only big difference in driving experience so far is the report from the G35's exhaust, a barely noticed difference in takeoff speed, the 35 weighs more, but had +2 hp, and slightly more torque - but is helped by Nissan's tuning, + it is rear wheel drive. I do miss the auto- stick a lot, but it was a small trade off +'s for the Honda: more for the money: leather, sunroof, 87 OCTANE, Michelins, ipod support, warranty and service costs

This is my 5th Honda. Starting at purchase year 1987- Prelude - through Accord. I purchased a 2004 V6- Leather and I did not think Honda could do any better with design or performance. I can tell you their research with design and engine has really served the new 2008 Honda Accord well. This car handles like no other Honda I have driven. It is simply the best by far and Looks great. Very Classy, Sporty design. I definitely recommend a test drive. You will not be disappointed.

After two months, my '08 Accord LX has 2,000 problem-free miles on it. I love the amount of interior room of this car. Fuel economy is good for its size (24 mpg with the 177-hp engine). The engine provides enough power for my daily routine. It has a comfortable ride and most controls are logical, but the location of the volume knobs takes some getting used to. Also, it's fairly agile. However, I do have a few complaints. The dash board curves and sticks out when trying to get in. Therefore, both I and front seat passengers have banged our knees while getting in. Also, for a $20,000 car, Honda should have had Maintenance Minder standard. Lastly, the LX's wheel covers look very cheap IMO.

Yes this is a family sedan that has the power and hints of a sports sedan. Highway passing is just a tap away all while pulling 26 to the gal. Around town gas mileage is not as good at 22 with a mix of city and high way.

I previously owned a Volvo and I was tempted to buy a 5 series BMW, but like my Volvo, I put on the brakes because I am still recovering from poor, costly and unnecessary repairs by three separate Volvo dealer service departments). Then, one day, I saw the new Accord on a parking lot and I said wow. Past Honda Accords have never appealed to me. I went to a dealer, sat in a bold beige leather EXL and bought it. I did not even test drive the car. So, I got a good looking car, Honda reliability at half a BMW price. I know a lot of people that are on second and third Hondas, so I am hoping that my car ownership experience leads me to become a loyal Honda owner too.

Since leasing my accord in Oct: 1: it broke down in December - had to replace the overhead cams, fuel injectors, battery and a few other things 2: in Feb I discover there is an oil leak 3: in Feb I feel a vibration when driving - have a rim & tire replaced and all tires balanced. Honda didn't have the specs to do a front end alignment and told me to wait 4: I meet with an arbitrator who then gets the car aligned - still vibrating 5: the car averages less then 20MPG in a good week. Sometimes as low as 17 6: I'm waiting to see what goes next?

I really think this car would be one of the most perfect ones out there, BUT... the auto transmission in the 6cy lacks the spunk and the fun. Bad hesitation from 2-3 or what I call a lazy shift. Also a hesitation if you need to pass on the freeway too. Honda, Get this resolved and you will be on top with this car. One the good, not, the inside in the EX-L is awesome, I feels like a jet airplane cockpit. Fit and Finish is excellent as well.

I have owed a 1999, 2003, 2006 and this one, a 2008 EX V6 w/nav. All of them were quality vehicles with excellent service records. I have never replaced more than a light bulb in any Honda I ever owned. The first of the 4 was a 4 cyl, the last three V6 and I prefer the V6 because it runs smoother and with the additional power does not tend to shift as often. The '08 Accord has a more firm ride than the '03 and '06 (I like this) the slightly longer and wider size is noticeable, and I thought the older models were big enough. Trunk space while is similar seems a little less usable, especially with the nav DVD box in the trunk. Mileage looks like it will be a little less than the older V6 Hondas

follow up to earlier posting. Have the car 20 days now. About 350 miles mainly stop and go driving to and from work Put gas in the other day for the first time and averaged about 21.7 MPG not bad for breaking the car in and for the first 318 miles on the car. I expect it will go up. Otherwise love the car.

I've had my 08 4-cyl 5MT EX-L Accord for over a month now, and overall I'm happy with the car. The tires/wheels were replaced by the dealer due to vibration problems at highway speeds. The MPG is not that great around 24.5 MPG in mixed driving. I guess when they match a 4-cyl with a heavier "large class" body, this is what you get.

This is my 3rd Accord lease and it's better than ever. Great ride , roomy interior, legendary Honda reliability. Some here have complained of poor gas mileage, but I've had mine almost two weeks, driven 300 miles so far in mostly city driving, and have a bit more than a quarter of a tank left. I should get close to 400 miles on a full tank in mostly stop and go traffic. Pretty good, I'd say.....

I own an Acura TL as well so am evaluating based upon on this. BLUF: Superlative sedan; would not hesitate to purchase again. Positives: Eye- catching appeal; fit and finish exterior/interior; safety features laudable; audio system good esp w/XM radio; interior room spacious; 3.5L V6 scoots; sporty handling and acceleration good; sporty leather seats; highway gas mileage; appearance package worth having; no dealer service yet; Negatives: Tough negotiations w/6 Wash DC dealers; city gas mileage; road noise; no keyless memory link w/driver profiles; steering wheel quality and size; console storage tray; outside mirrors don?t pivot downward when backing; It is a winner and a recommended buy.

The re-designed exterior is great- looking. I see older Accords on the road and they look boxy and nondescript. The '08 is a beauty, especially in the deep burgundy. The interior is fantastic. Big and spacious, with a ton of high-end features (on the model I got) like Navigation, heated seats, XM, dual climate control (automatic too), auto- dimming rear view mirror, 6-CD stereo, nice leather, etc. Riding in this car feels very similar to riding in cars that cost $15k more. The ride is great too. I don't know why some folks bemoan the VCM shifting between 6, 4, and 3 cylinders. I don't notice a thing. It is very smooth and seamless. I really like this car a lot.

I've been driving pure sports cars for years (last one a 350Z and the one before that a twin-turbo RX7) and when Honda showed the new coupe in January 2007, I read all about it. I knew I had to have one, especially as the car has fwd and I've suffered through winter driving for years. Ordered my blue coupe in August and waited, waited. Finally in November the dealer traded for a car just like the one I wanted except it had a different color interior. Well, I fell in love with it and took it because I wanted it so badly. Boy, it sure didn't disappoint! This car sure isn't the run-of-the-mill Honda. My son owns a 2005 Accord Coupe with 4 cylinder and a 5-speed, and my car puts his to shame!

Having spent the day comparing fuel efficent cars again I though it might be time to re visit my local Honda store. Gas as we all know is about to hit $4 a gallon by summer so in I went for my quest for the eigth generation Accord. I purchased the EX-l 4 cylinder without/nav( cannot see paying nearly $3000 more just for directions.. so for my evaluation this being my third Accord and by a land slide the best(the others 89",07). First off the new body style is very appealing and the new seats are more forgiving for larger men. Acceleration A+, fit and finish are up to quality with cars thousands more. XM radio and premium sound are top notch. Ride quality and handling are spot on! Honda# 1

Excellent car, would recommend this to anyone looking for a sharp, reliable, comfortable sedan. Mine is diamond pearl with tented windows, rear spoiler, 28800 out the door. No better car for the money in my opinion.

Lets be fair, how many cars out there with the price around 21K to 24K and gives you what Accord LX offers? I drive 100 miles everyday since Nov '07 and I absolutly love this car. It's fun to drive, handling is great. The moonroof is cool to have, it gives you good ventilation in the cold days when the heat is turn-up, and of course the exterior look is a killer.

I have owned some 30 plus used cars and decided to treat myself to a new car. I read reviews and studied for 5 months.This car has been nothing but a dream to drive. No buyers remorse. I have driven 2000 miles in 30 days. Snow, Rain, dry, day, night. 4 cyl delivers great power but a little hungry on fuel. Blind spots. Set your mirrors well. Backing up tricky at first, my 2nd night I almost hit a tree. The transmission shifts so smooth & correctly. Handling awesome. Corners well. Road noise a bit higher than it should be but that's why they gave a great sound system. A little pricy but it's really a comfortable car and a great driving machine.

I love my Honda. This is my first Honda and I must say I am very impressed. I only drive it on the weekends so I have no gripes over fuel economy. It feels great to get into my Honda after driving my 01' Pontiac Sunfire. It handles well and it is smooth sailing. The heated seats for me and my passenger are a plus for the cold weather.

Driving is easy, fun. Car is nimble and rides over bumps and railroad tracks with suprising smoothness.

<DOC>


I cannot say how disappointed I am with this car. Horrible transmission - long delays while upshifting, slam on the brakes feeling while downshifting. Do not buy this car if you are looking for a smooth ride. VCM feature makes it feel like the car is constantly hunting for gears at 60-70 mph. Fuel economy is horrendous -- 17 in the city at best, even despite the VCM. Honda says car is "operating normally" so if you think you're going to do better, it's not likely.

I traded in my 05 Accord 4 cyl LX for this one. Before I bought the V6 I test drove the 2.4L and wasn't impressed enough to make the swap.However,about two months later I test drove the 3.5L V6 and was surprised how big of a difference there was in power. The 3.5L brings out the cars sporty side. Its definitely a more grown up Accord. You get the looks and power of a luxury car without the price.I have owned Cadillac's to Kia's and this is by far one of the best cars I've owned. I love the styling the performance and handling. To me they got it just right. If mpg is a main concern dont get the 3.5L, although it does well in its own right. Larger, quieter, more sporty what more can you ask for.

This is our 2nd Honda Accord. We traded in a BMW 325i as it was rear wheel drive and not a good car to drive in the snow. Previously we owned a 98 V6 Accord, it was a great car and so we figured that we couldn't go wrong with the new accord, we loved the body style. The car is fabulous, except for one thing, it is a GAS HOG! For a 4 cylinder honda engine we expected to get better than 23 mpg, especially since my wife drives about 90% freeway miles at 65. The sticker said to expect up to 31, boy was that a lie! Our 6 cylinder BMW averaged 26 mpg on the same drive!

The new '08 Accord is once again an example of Honda design and engineering excellence. I traded in a great '04 Accord for the new model and can tell the changes in ride quality in the new model. This car makes you feel like you are driving a $50,000+ car for under $30,000. A+++

This is a Great Car!! Had it for 2 weeks. Great comfort in the Accord. Plenty of zip!! Awesome mileage 22 in town!! Great fit and finish. Haven't really pushed it yet, but fun to drive! I have had no issues. Unless you count getting rear ended 2 days ago (ugh!! didn't even have my new plates yet). New bumper on the way!! Color is great and have had several compliments already. Quiet with a great ride. Awesome stereo!! Plenty of room in the back for our 14 year old daughter and her two friends. Based on first two weeks everyone should buy one. Wanted a 6 speed, but impossible to find. Traded in a premium gas guzzling/problem plagued 2004 RX8. It was fun to drive but too many problems.

I have owned this car for only a few days. Had a 1999 Honda Accord LX that got totaled so needed a new car. What a great car. So roomy on the inside, nice size trunk and great Honda quality that we all come to expect. I am very pleased with this car and purchased it over Nissan Altima and Hyundai Sonata. The base model has all the features one could want at a minimum in the car, keyless entry, daytime running lights, 6 airbags, power windows/door locks, steering wheel controls for cruise control and audio system. Also the automatic maintanence reminder is a great plus for this car.

This is my third Honda and it's just superb. With a V6 and nearly 270hp on the engine, its ready to race with any other on the road. VCM works out nice for better mileage. Awesome interior with great comfort.great accelaration. Great interior features. It puts out power no sooner you stomp on the accelerator unlike a few other other cars which think for a while before responding. No regret in buying this beautiful car.

I traded my 08 Mazda Cx7 which was a Lemon for an 08 Honda Accord Coupe EX 4cyl AT. I had my Accord for 3 weeks now and I super love it. This is my first Honda and Im amazed of the quality and value for my money. My family and friends love the car too. It's a head turner..

 I've had two Accords prior to this one and I like this the best. It's the roomiest of all, has good power and MPG are good, has a smooth engine and transmission. I almost bought a Fit but was too small for a family of five. I like the fit and finish, ergonomics, driving position and handling.

First Honda, probably my last. Replaced 2005 Camry that was totaled in a rear-end collision. Have owned the Accord LX since November '07. 1400 miles. Over 60. Three months and I still can't get comfortable in the LX. In my opinion: hard seats, hard ride, more road noise than expected, disappointing gas mileage. For test drive(s), I wish I had removed the hard plastic from the driver's seat; tried harder to get comfortable in the non-electric seat; spent more time on rough roads. I did several back to back test drives with Accord/Camry. I admit I was caught up (a bit) in the new styling of the Accord... but I do miss the more comfortable ride of my '05 & '96 Camry's. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


This is my seventh Accord. The new body styling is a big plus and the interior has the look of a more expensive vehicle. All things considered Honda gives you the best value for the price. Many standard features are options on the Altima and Camery. Not sold on the VCM.

How did Honda build a bigger Accord with more horsepower and keep the same fuel economy? THEY DIDN'T!! The advertised 21 city/31 hwy is way off. I've put 1000 miles on mine and I'm averaging about 19 MPG. Living in Los Angeles I do a lot of city driving, but my previous car ('03 Toyota Highlander w/ V6) got the same fuel economy. Not good for a 4 cyl sedan. The ride is also hard. Again, my SUV felt softer. Otherwise the car is comfortable, stylish, spacious and it handles well. The navi, Bluetooth, XM radio features are great. Get this car if you want a stylish family sedan with a good track record. Don't get it if you want good fuel economy & luxury ride.

Traded my 2006 Lexus IS250 for a 2008 Acoord coupe I4. Boy no regrets at all. I see some frustradted people here who are not that happy with the new Accord. It is all in your head if you belive that your car is fun, you will feel that. I love my coupe inside and out, great looks and very responsive engine for a four cylinder. And great gas mileage averaging 28.5 on regular gas. Easy to get in and out on the back seat. Very comfortable ride compared to my Lexus. I would recommend anybody shopping for a new car. Great car, looks and plan to keep it for a long time( I have cahnged 6 cars in 5 years)

I was looking for a luxury-feel car with great performance at a good price. My two choices were the Honda Accord & the Acura TL. The Honda Accord EX-L V6 with sat nav won because it was just as luxurious as the TL for a lot less money.

Bought my Honda in November 2007. This is my second Honda Accord and so far I have not been disappointed. My previous Honda Accord was a 1996 and it is still going strong. I hope to have the same success out of the 2008 model. I was looking for a new sedan that would have plenty of leg room for my two sons and so far I have been pleased. I compared it to the Nissan Altima which came in a close second but the Accord had better safety features and the insurance is cheaper. I have been disappointed with fuel economy. 75% of my driving is state highways and I only get about 26-27 miles/gal. which is less than my previous 12 yr. old Accord.

So...I'm at the honda dealer getting my oil change and saw how nice the 08 coupe looked, what a beauty! So I traded in my 06 and got this one. Best buy ever!! I mean, it handles so well, turn radius actually got smaller, and not to mention how sexy this car looks. The V6 manual transmission is still fairly new to me and having to readjust from driving a V4. The coupe responds so well to acceleration, even at low rpms. Gears are a bit tricky but I've only had the car for a week, so im still learning her. But major complaints, it's definitely a very fun car to drive and handles smoothly. I can't wait to break her in and really test her.

My wife and I looked at many sedans and decided to go with the 2008 Honda Accord (purc. 10/16/07) because of its reputation on quality. We enjoyed our new Accord for about 200 miles when the rear brakes started to squeal (radio would not even drown the sound out) during braking. We took the car into the dealership (10/30/07) and they replaced the pads and scuffed the rotors. Again on 11/30/07 we took our car in for the same issue and they replaced the rear pads and rotors. Again on 12/6/07 we took the car in for the same issue and they replaced the front rotors, pads and calipers. Since then we have taken the car in 2 more times for the same squealing brakes (they still have not fixed them).

190hp 4cyl vtec has good smooth power for a 4 cyl. revs up there with no complaints. The steering is pretty tight but different in a way if you're used to more road feel it leans more toward isolation IMHO... but good . The interior is tight and well put together. I'm already used to the "buttony" radio /ac controls... look, its not that bad, everything is reachable with one hand like typing! The looks of the car "grew" on me . I like it a lot now. I guess I was expecting the new 08 Accord to look dressed up ordinary but it looks classy and sleek to me. I love the way it handles, it has 17 inchers on it - Michelin 225s. Road noise not an issue with me, its acceptable.

I am so disappointed in this car. The VCM system has basically ruined what would otherwise be an exceptional car. Contrary to what Honda says, the VCM transitions are NOT seamless, and IS noticeable to the passengers. I am not optimistic about Honda fixing this, and am ready to take a loss intrading the vehicle in on something different with only a few hundred miles on it. My '07 Accord V-6 is a vastly superior vehicle.

</DOC>
<DOC>


The Accord is indeed a nice car. Very disappointed in mileage. Nowhere near the mileage the sticker shows. Only getting 21 MPG on highway while driving speed limit. I also have a Honda Odyssey that "implied" I could get 29 MPG. I can only get 22 MP. Both vehicles are the 6cyl with the VCM. I think Honda needs to correct this. One of the driving factors for the purchase was the fuel economy. Outside of that, the car is excellent.

Bought nighthawk black metallic, what a head turner. Most lookers cannot believe it's a Honda. Faster than my previous 324i and takes off like a rocket and handles like a dream. Traded 2004 EX-L V6 4 dr also a great car but cannot compete with this beauty. High Honda quality interior materials, great stereo, and loaded with every option you could think of.

The car is fabulous, both inside and out. I'm currently at 4,500 miles and the MPG gets better at each fill up. I drive 80-90% HWY, and am now starting to get almost 31 MPG. The first fill I got 28 MPG and then it was 29 MPG and last time was 30.5 MPG. Another great thing is oil changes, my dash indicator says 60% engine oil still available until it needs changed. I'm under the assumption that I can go up to 10,000 miles before my 1st oil change!

I've only had my Accord for a few days. This is my first Honda ever. My main reason for purchasing this car was to get a fuel-efficient vehicle that also was comfortable to drive on long trips. Little did I know, when I bought the car, I would be getting so much more. I normally don't like to drive. This car is fun, though. For years, I've resisted 4 cylinder vehicles because I like to have good power while driving for quick takeoffs in the city and good speed for passing on the highway. So far this car is a prime example of having my cake and eating it too. The interior is luxurious and large. I have long legs and the Accord EX-L sedan has more than enough room for me.

If you are thinking of buying a 2008 Honda Accord 6 cylinder, I would suggest you think twice and drive it more than just a test drive. The VCM is terrible. I would not buy the car again because of this "feature". The service department told me there was nothing they could do and to go back to sales. The surging (even at times on cruise) is terribly annoying. Otherwise, the car is outstanding.

I bought my fourth Honda in December.I traded in my 2006 Se 4 door Accord.Boy do I regret that.I am having problems with the passenger side seat track,pealing paint on the rear bumper,Horrible Upholstery on the drivers side,and the major thing is an Major electrical problem with the Headlights and taillights flickering and dimming when you use the a/c and the cooling fans kick on and off.The dash lights and radio go in and out also with this problem.The 2008 Accord is a danger to the road....am a Handicapped citizen and basically Honda does not care about their faulty products.

I just purchased my Polished Metal EX- L yesterday. Honda did a really nice job with this Accord. Acceleration is very quick for a 4 cylinder. The steering feel and handling of the car is athletic. The interior is great. The seats are supportive and the materials are great. Exterior styling, in my opinion is very attractive. Reminds me of a cross between an Acura RL and a BMW 5 series. I showed the car to a friend of mine and he commented that it was almost like a luxury car inside. He owns a BMW.

Purchased my Accord in November 07. I have put aprox 2000 miles on it. Traded 06 Accord. I love the appearance of the car from the outside, and it has a much bigger feel to it, ride is a little stiff but smooth, engine is very responsive, however gas mileage is diappointing getting 5 mpg less then 06 Accord. Interior is nice but not as comfortable as past Accords and feels a little cheap. Biggest disappointment is the audio system, stereo reception is terrible, rear speakers are AWFUL. Honda you should be ashamed, expected better from a 24K automobile. What is the deal with no coin holder? This is my 3rd Accord probably my least favorite. Lots of room for improvement here.

good car ...horrible headlights...put the air on and watch the headlights flicker...honda refuses to fix it says its normal..do not buy this car if you drive ar night...if you must buy it make sure you take a test drive at night with the air on..get out and watch the exterior lights...only happens on the 4 cylnder accords..also horrible gas mileage..18-19 around town..whatever you do dont open both rear windows doing 70 mph..you will think the roof is going to blow off..if you drive in snow be advised it piles up on the drivers side windshield in the groove honda put there.

I just purchased the Accord 08 EX-L V6. I had shopped a Honda Civic, Toyota Camry & Prius, Acura TSX, used Accords, etc. I am extremely satisfied after the first week; though it was more costly, I still like the smooth power and handling of the V-6, the comfort of the leather interior, and something new for me... satellite radio. I had no idea it so extensive. This Accord model has a great balance of features that blends attractive styling, driveablity, build quality, economy, and comfort with all the loaded options that I will enjoy over several years and 100000+ miles of anticipated driving. Plus, and this is big for me, the great crash test scores and safety features of the car.

Just a follow-up to "My First New Car" report after another 700 miles in my new base model Accord. Overall MPG is 21.2 miles per gallon, with 60% city traffic and 40% freeway driving. The engine performs flawlessly. I heard the VSA kick in today during a sudden 110-degree left turn, NASCAR manuver. The VSA prevented my car from spinning out and made me look like a pro. The driver's left shoulder has a sizeable blind spot. From morning, cold startups, the steering wheel gives some squeaks and noises the first time you turn it as you back out of a parking spot, a recurring problem. Left and right sides of the trunk are somewhat taken up by the bulges

Overweight - 3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver. Real world economy is down compared to last year's models. All in all very disappointing - and I have owned 14 Honda/Acura products since 1981.

After several months researching Accord, Camry, and Altima I was very happy that the silver V-6 Accords were in production. At first I was apprehensive about buying a first year model redesign but the auto info was very positive. After 2 weeks on the road and 1,000 miles I am even more pleased with my car than the day I bought it. With all the research I did before the purchase there were no surprises. The response on windy mountain roads is very controlled. I like the variable cylinder management feature where the 4 and 3 cylinder mode kick in when less power is needed. The first trip I got over 28 mpg going up to 70 mph where allowed. Combined city/highway over 22 mpg

</DOC>
<DOC>


First let me say that this is my first Honda and I am very, very impressed! After narrowing a search down to the Accord and the Camry, this by far was the best choice. The interior design and the performance of the V6 are the highlights. The interior room is plentiful... this coming from someone who went down in size from a Pacifica to a sedan. The navigation system is the best I've ever seen in a car. Almost the entire interior of the car can be controlled by voice commands such as temp., radio volume, navigation, etc. All in all a home run hit by Honda in my book.

I am a previous Acura TSX owner. Before that I had an 04 Honda accord coupe. I just knew when I got my TSX I was never going to get another Honda again, until i saw the 08 Accord coupe. Got it 11/07. I totally love it!! The new body style is off the hook!! I catch people looking to see what kind of car it is all the time. I had the chrome door handles installed to give it an extra kick as I did not want to pay the extra for the V-6. The inside is much bigger than the 04 coupe and the TSX. Totally stands out. Can't wait until the summer time to let the windows down and open the moonroof!! I love my new coupe!!!

After nine days driving this car, the experience has surpassed the expectations. The only way to describe my experiences is just plain AWESOME. This car is turns heads everywhere I drive like an expensive luxury car

50 days of ownership, and I absolutely love to drive it. The V6 power is such a push-you-into-your-seat contrast to my previous 20 years in 4 cylinder Hondas. A lot of fun to drive. Engine acceleration growl is noticeable (and kinda cool) in the lower gears but not while cruising. Wind and road noise don't seem loud to me, nor completely bubble-quiet either. Black leather interior is very classy and plastic trim is nice. Nav system is handy for people like me that get lost easy, plus great for finding nearest gas stations, etc. Just wish it could show my iPod song details (and control it). Have had many compliments on the looks. My neighbor thought I had bought a Mercedes coupe

I have certainly enjoyed driving my new Accord coupe. The few areas where I have been a little disappointed is in the fuel economy. I have been babying the gas pedal for the first 1000 miles, but I'm still averaging about 21-22 mpg. Some of that is likely atributed to warming the car up for about 4 to 5 minutes on cold mornings. Also, about 60% of my driving is on local roads. However, my old Audi A4(4cyl turbo) would average 26-27mpg driving the same routes (but driving a bit more agressively). My cd changer also makes some noise every few minutes as if it's changing cd's (even when the audio system is turned off). My overall experience is possitive, but I expected a little better.

This is my 2nd Honda accord. I had a 2000 Accord which I bought brand new and I have no complaints that's why I bought the new 08 Accord. I've had it for 3 months now and I've had no complaints except for 1, the most MPG I get on city is only 20mpg, sometimes 17 which makes me hate their "goodbye to gasoline" ad because it's not true. I don't drive aggressively, so I don't know if I got bad build or what.

I have had my Belize Blue 2008 Accord Coupe V6 6-speed with navigation for nearly 3 weeks. All I can say - what an amazing car! Nothing but excellent ratings (except for gas milage, which should improve as the car breaks in). The Accord couple is great fun to drive, especially with the 6-speed manual transmission. If this car was any faster, it would be scary! I traded a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS V6 5-speed manual, and there is no comparison. I would highly recommend this car to anyone - and if you like to drive a "sports car", get the V6 6- speed. Navigation system and Bluetooth are very functional. I have received many compliments from strangers on my Accord!

Bought my EX-L V-6 Coupe on 2/1/08 and then had to take a road trip. The interior is plenty spacious and once I mastered all the controls and settings, they were easy enough to operate. This is replacing a very nice '05 Altima SE V-6 sedan, which had a lot of space I didn't use. The Honda's steering is much nice than the Altima, the turning radius is much smaller. Handling is excellent; body roll almost imperceptible, braking nice and stout, acceleration strong and steady. The trunk is more than sufficient for duffel bags, groceries, etc, although I wish I had the optional cargo net as things do slide around a lot. I have had several people ask me what kind of car it is already!

Well, after having the car for a month I have to say the experience so far is very disappointing. The VCM is so annoying - hunting between modes at highway speeds. The surging/lurching is noticeable and not seamless and makes my wife ill - she thinks I am doing something - I have it on cruise!! Fuel "economy" is not as good as on 2004 coupe we had - only 27-28 on the road.

We bought a 07 Pilot and fell in love with the Honda quality and the local dealer sales and service. When it was time to buy a sedan Honda was the first place I looked. I wanted a larger car that was comfortable and the redesign of the Accord making it bigger made the difference. I looked at the Toyota Avalon (too expensive) and the Lincoln MKZ (iffy quality for the price). Some friends who both drive Lexus' rode in the back of the Accord and raved about how much room there was and how nice the car was.

Not looking to purchase a Honda I came across the Accord Coupe and I had to have it. The looks, ride, and quality are second to none. I highly recommend the Accord Coupe to anyone looking to buy a new car considering fuel economy.

Driving the 8th Generation Driving Machine is not too smooth (like Altima or Camry) but feels the same good old Accord (the manly drive feel). Lots of power in the new machine at 2600 RPM I made 80 MPH (of course more power) than the previous Accords. Wonderful to drive.

I was looking for a mid size coupe with style, performance and all season traction capability. I was also looking at a price that would not murder my budget. I found all this with the new for '08 Honda Accord EXL V6 MT Coupe! The car is roomy inside, comfortable, handles and performs great and is fun to drive. I have also received many "thumbs ups" from enthusiastic onlookers.

Styling in and out is fantastic, and the v-6 performance is all one would hope for and more. Can get close to epa with cruise on highway. Handles brilliantly on all surfaces without any complaints. Had to emergency pass on freeway, went from 65 to 90 in a flash with superior handling without as much as a shake or rattle.

My 2008 honda accord ex headlights flicker approximately every 30 seconds when the A/C is on. They flicker at idle and while driving. This is a major safety issue and its against the law to have flickering lights on a four wheel vehicle. Honda says this is normal for the vehicle. This is unacceptable and should be recalled.

You are hearing from a previous 2005 Acura TL owner, so this Accord had a lot of living up to do. I sold my TL to try something new, a 2007 Volvo S80. Total piece of junk. It was in the shop so much that Volvo ended up making one of my monthly payments from me. So I unloaded the Volvo and was out car hunting when I came across the new Accord coupe. It was love at first site. I first purchased an 08" coupe 4 cylinder with cloth. But after a few weeks, it wasn't powerful enough, so I took it back and the dealer gave me a good deal and I got the V-6 EX-L. What an awesome car. Totally worth the extra $3k. You get a V-6, heated leather seats, XM, 18" rims. Buy this car, in the V- 6. You'll love it

</DOC>

I really like this car a lot. For the money, it is definitely the best choice out there. I got the 4 cylinder LX model in a manual transmission, and it has more than enough power. I was actually suprised at the acceleration for this base model engine. My only really complaint is the gas mileage is not as good as advertised. I do about 90% highway driving and I am only getting 22-23 mpg which isn't that bad considering it is a big car. But other than that, I would definitely recomend this car to anyone, especially taller people!

Being a new graduate and starting my new job, my primary goal was to get a new car. Initially, I was planning to get a luxury sedan, however the payments are way too high. I decided to go with a Honda Accord Coupe LX-S because I got an amazing deal, reliability, and looks. I couldn't have asked for a better car. Although it lacks the power and acceleration that luxury cars offer, it is still an amazing vehicle. The handling is real tight and going from 50 MPH to 70 MPH is where the fun begins. When stopping at a red light, other motorist stare at the car probably trying to guess what kind of car it is. IMO the front looks similar to the Lexus IS250 and the side of the car looks like a G37.

Driven about 2500 miles so far. Very Stable on the highway. Really have to step on it in the city, as it is a heavy car. It feels safe though. Handling is not as quick as you would want it due to its weight. Mileage is decent around 24-27. I enjoy driving it everyday. Few problems the inside door handle holder is loose. It pops out when you pull the door handle. Also if you have the dealer installed tire pressure tire valve caps, take them off as some of them were leaking air from the tires and this car already has tire pressure monitoring so you dont need it. I wish the lower gears would change faster and not rev so much all the time. I also wish they had heated mirrors with LX-S.

Only getting 15 mph city driving & 20 mph overall on 1/2 highway-1/2 city driving using very conservative driving habits! Fuel economy not good for a 4 cylinder engine built by a firm advertising itself as "the most fuel efficient automaker in the world." 190 hp engine has plenty of power when you need it to accelerate onto the highway. Steering is very precise with only about 2 turns of the wheel lock-to- lock. Has great ride/handling balance- not too firm yet not too soft-so you don't sacrifice the ride to get good handling. Autotransmission upshifts/downshifts smoothly. Cloth front seats big & comfortable. Three people easily fit in back seat. Love the sunroof. Do not notice road noise.

Purchased my 4dr EXL V6 2 weeks ago. Have put approx 175 highway miles on it. VCM/Tranny on highway are very noticable to the point it is annoying. The VCM/Tranny switching back and forth make you wonder what the car is doing all the time. Seats are stiff but once adjusted seem to become more comfortable. Suspension/driving are better than past Accords and engine has plenty of power. Overall an improvement over older Accords but VCM/Tranny issues have me concerned about the longetivity of this car.

3000 Miles on my new long awaited 08 V6 Sedan. This car is a nightmare. Shifting is up and down, surging and vibration at higher speeds is ridiculous like I have 4 unbalanced tires ( I don?t). I am shocked that Honda would put this into production. The constant shifting and changing of the VCM is maddening and almost can make you nauseous. The vibration juts adds another layer of frustration. Dealer has the car now for the last week!! They agree it?s not right and working with Honda to see what can be done. So far the picture looks bleak. Buyers be informed!

Well, the '08 Accord (LX 4 cyl) is an awesome car. Honda delivers again. Except...its just ugly. The engine is the most refined in its class, maybe the world, the build quality is polished, and the transmission/chassis is superb. But it looks like something my grandma might buy if she wanted something "young and hip". Recently drove a new Malibu, and am hooked. Seriously considering a trade.

Traded in my Oddysey for better gas mileage and more comfort. So far not super impressed with gas mileage, and comfort, well lets just say my dealership just ordered a new seat cushion for me today. I feel like somehow a Civic LX seat ended up in my loaded Accord. I drive 50k plus miles a year, and am not sure if I will make it even 6 months if they cannot solve this problem and soon. Comfort is my only real complaint. I am 6'1" tall, 210lbs...not overly large. Seat feels like it cuts into my left leg on long trips. I highly recommend driving this car more than down the street before spending this kind of money! Other features are wonderful. Gas mileage will surely improve, hopefully.

I just bought my Accord 2 weeks ago and am very happy with my decision. This is my 4th Accord and was considering the switch to the Acura TL. I decided I wanted one more coupe and am glad I did. I got the EX-L in Belize Blue and opted for all the extras: spoiler, fog lights, mud flaps, and tinted windows. This car looks great! The interior is very similar to that of the TL, but for about $7k less. I traded my '04 EX-L for this one, yet there a few things I miss like the electro-illuminescent gauges. My biggest fear is that of the other drivers and the amount of door dings I always get on my cars and this car doesnt seem much stronger. The passenger seat rattles, but other than that..nice car

This is my sixth Honda and my fifth new EX-L. I had a 2003 EX-L 4 cylinder so that got a consistent 28-30 mpg in town and over 35mpg on the highway. I drove from Minneapolis to Chicago and still had a titch under a quarter tank of gas left. The 2008 is getting anywhere from 18 to 23 mpg in town (a big difference at $3 per gallon) but I'm still seeing about 31 mpg on the highway. The reason? Simple physics. The car is heavier and there's 30 more horses to feed. Still, I think Honda should have considered MPG efficiency although I am a bit spoiled by the 2003. The 2008 is a work of art. Driving is magnificent. The trade-off is a bit lower mileage but still better than most out there.

Yup! I couldn't resist so we just picked up my, I repeat my, Accord this week. Even with all my previous complaining I added the Navigation option and I have to say it is very nice, but still overpriced. The Accord has a tremendous environment. I purposely take the long way to destinations. I notice that I now drive with a big smile on my face. What a car! I did test drive the coupe and found it too confining due to an almost 2" difference in headroom. I did not like the interior door moldings that covered the door controls. All in all, per Honda's website, the sedan has 19 advantages over the coupe so my decision was a no-brainer and I have never regretted my decision.

This is my 5th Accord in 22 years of driving and I have to say, I am very impressed. Having had to give up my 99 Accord due to very high mileage (170K+), this Accord was a bit of a change. Overall, I do not regret this purchase. The only minor issue is a glich with the headlights/fog lights while the air is on. When the compressor cycles on, the lights "blink" or dim very quickly. It reminds me of when your air unit or fridge comes on at home. It does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying. I contacted the dealer and they said it was something that was not fixable and that they would report it to Honda Corporate. Let's hope they come up with a fix.

After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid-size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety - Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. But 2008 is a year of Honda Accord. My my, I have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick-up, mileage and comfort that I am enjoying with my new 2008 Honda Accord. People do compare sedan's outer body trim with BMW 5-series, but I feel its really unique and give elegant looks as compared to older Honda models. Moreover, range of trime lines gives tough competition to Camry. I admire engine performance and comfort while driving atleast 30 mile a day to job.

Replaced old reliable '98 accord 5 spd with this car. Have been waiting a good year for it and I am generally pleased. Corners flatter than old Accord, although it seems a little slower, despite the bump in hp. The seats are very firm, but getting used to this. Fit and finish seems very nice so far. The stereo is not great, despite the specs, and I will probably change the rear speakers, which are mediocre. Back seat is expansive, great for three growing kids, one of the real plusses of this car. The stick is very smooth, and this really allows one to appreciate the vtec engine. Mileage so far is the big disappointment, low 20's, old Accord was never below 27mpg.

I have owned several Accords, the most recent one being a 2005 EX V6. We never had any problems with that car. I wish I had never traded. This new car has many neat features, such as the NAV and the variable cylinder management, but the build quality has me regretting my purchase. There are many rattles and squeaks,(the front end even rattles when you shut the door). But, the most annoying problem is a wind noise above 55mph. I get mad thinking about it and avoid driving it for that reason. Should have bought a Cadillac CTS.

</DOC>

The best way to review this car is to compare it my 06 Altima 3.5SL that I traded in. The Altima was faster, had more options, and a better Bose stereo. I still prefer the Accord. Build quality is fantastic. It feels both luxurious and sporty at the same time. Every texture feels upscale. Every button is full of precision and is satisfying to touch. The car steers and drives effortlessly but retains a degree of connectedness to the driving experience. I couldn't be happier with the car.

A great car for teens. My brother, an 18 year old, was traveling at 40 mph down a road. Someone ran a stop sign in a large SUV going around 60 mph and they both plowed into each other. Both cars were totaled, but the Honda was so safe that no one inside was injured. The car never had a problem, mechanically or otherwise. It was well priced and drove well. It had a smooth ride and had great pickup. A real head turner. On the inside, it was for the most part comfortable and luxurious. We are going to buy Honda for life because of our excellent experience with the car. It saved a teen's life. When the police arrived, they thought it was fatal. Note: incredibly easy to park.

The seats in my 2008 which is just like a 2009 are considerably less than I'm used to from Honda. They are definitely cutting corners and making the vehicle cheaper. I discovered one of the reasons to be that my 08 Honda was made in Japan and imported rather than made in Marysville like my others. I believe this made a considerable difference in vehicles and would recommend that anyone purchasing a new one look very close at assembly location on the window sticker...

Only had the car for 1 year and the rear inner pads and roters needed to be replaced already. I bought the car brand new and now only has 18,000 miles. Honda is NOT doing anything about this known issue problem. If you google "2008 Honda Accord brake problem" you will see a thousand complaints about the defective brake system. Honda should be held responsible for defective brake system. Right rear inner pad wears out around 15,000 miles.

I have owned 4 honda's and have come to rely on the fantastic quality of performance and lack of maintenance issues. I can literally change the oil religiously with a Honda and it will go forever. Not with this latest purchase. I have owned the vehicle for 1 year and 7 months with 21,000 miles and just paid for new rear brake pads! Unbelievable that after only 3...three oil changes, I am replacing brake pads. WOW Honda! I am extremely disappointed that the reliability and quality that I have come to expect from your cars has come to this.

I have happily bought and driven Hondas for over 30 years--until now. My 2008 EX-L V6, with mostly highway miles totaling 28,500 recently needed new rear brakes at a cost of nearly $360. The front brakes are fine. They tell me that this is normal wear...yet asked if I may have driven with the parking brake on or "ridden"the brakes....I don't believe it! I called Honda to articulate my concerns, and I have seen many other similar complaints on the web! This needs to be investigated....Since the car was the new model, I suspect that as time goes on, this flaw will become more apparent...

I bought my car in Dec 07' and put 31k since then, all highway miles. At 25k I needed a new wheel bearing which was covered under warranty. At 30k I brought it into the dealer because the check engine light was on. Took the mechanics 2 days to figure out what was wrong with the car. Ended up that I needed a new cylinder in my engine plus a couple spark plugs replaced. The dealer did not have any explanation of why this happened. Thank god that I bought the extended warranty or that would have been a huge bill. Extremely disappointed with this car. I bought it for its reliability and all I have gotten is trips to the dealer to get it fixed. Will never buy this car again.

The best dealership on the planet, and a car that is as close to perfect as you can get. I am negotiating a trade for another presently and the depreciation is minimal. I seriously doubt that I could lease for the price that I am about to trade. The car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish -the whole banana ! The only hiccup I can report is that I think that the seats in our 2008 Odyssey are a bit more comfortable. Don't get me wrong, the Accord is a comfortable car, I am just a big guy and the seats just feel like they could use a little more of something. Do yourself a favor and get one of these for yourself.

The Accord is the best car that I have ever had, RELIABLE, POWERFUL, CLASSY all bundled in one package. I will always be a Honda buyer but the way this car is still holding up I wont need a car for years and year to come! I have driven the car 10 months since I purchased BRAND NEW and EVERYTHING still works like the day it did when first purchased NEW, simply flawless. I had to have an EX with the Manual Trans. Fun to drive, very peppy through each gear and the clutch is very sensitive so you can barely touch it and go threw each gear. THANKS HONDA FOR MY ACCORD, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

I bought my car last year after an accident totaled my 2007 Nissan Altima coupe and can I just say I miss my Altima. : ( my family talked me into the car... Telling me how good the gas mileage is (not true... my Altima got better city) and how the features outnumber any car in its class. But the bottom line is the car's stereo system... it's just weird, if you don't have navigation some of the buttons are oddly placed (the tuner 2.5 in nob) the display under the speedometer could be more helpful (telling me how many miles / gallon I have, telling me how my speed affects my gas mileage... etc.). But I will say that it's larger than any other coupe I looked at. It's a good car... but it could be better.

First, let me say that I have been driving Toyota cars for the past 10+ years. I was on my way to replace my Camry with yet another Camry and decided to give the Accord a try. 4 hours later, I think I will be driving Honda cars from now on. First, the new Accord compared to the new Camry is no longer a matter of taste: the Accord is not only better, it is in a separate class altogether. Workmanship is better, materials are better, the EX-L has more options than the Camry XLE and is cheaper! Go figure. More fun to drive, no under steer and mushy brakes like the Camry... I simply love it.

The 2008 Honda Accord EX-L V6 is an ideal combination of comfort, economy, and pleasure! I have owned either a Mercedes or BMW for my last 3 cars and find the Honda as an ideal alternative to the high cost of ownership of those German automobiles. No, the Honda does not have the anti-sway of those vehicles in high-cornering speeds, but it is more comfortable. I have two herniated disks and the seats of the Honda have alleviated the pain in my legs and back when I drive. I owned a 1994 Honda EX and must admit that this new Accord is like the difference between watching regular and HDTV. Wow, a product that actually exceeded my expectations! Give this car consideration if you want a near-luxo.

Purchased the Accord EX-L V6 new versus a used Infinity M35 or Acura. The EX-L compares very favorably versus any other sedan in its class and has many of the basic features found in "near- luxury" cars at a reasonable price. Park it next to a BMW 5 series and you see the exterior design similarities. This car would be perfect except for one major complaint, the design of the driver's seat. There is a bulge about halfway up the seatback that is immovable and eliminates any support for your shoulders. This is independent from the lower lumbar support. It may not be noticable to you on a brief test drive so check this out before buying, as there is no solution available from the dealer.

This is an awsome car! In reality it is an Acura RL in 2 wheel drive instead of 4 wheel in the Acura RL at half the price. The performance is incredible! With 268 hp it should be. Gas mileage is great for a vehicle with this type of performance. The looks are georgeous. It has 5 star ratings in front crash, side crash and roll over. Plenty of room for 5 inside. There is no better car for the money IMHO

I've had my Honda for 2 weeks. About a week ago I noticed that my car had a 1 second delay when shifting into drive. When stepping on the accelerator, it would take a moment to actually shift into gear. I also dislike the way the car down shifts when you take your foot off the pedal. It's very noticable...moves you forward in your seat. And when shifting from one gear to the next...well it's rough. I took my car into the dealer and they said it was normal for the Accord. We even test drove another car just like mine and it did the same thing. I'm in the process of trying to give it back and filing a complaint. Who makes a car that has a delay when shifting into drive? Normal?..whatever!

I was impressed by the styling of this all new make over. It reminds me of a more expensive car. I recently sold my 90 Accord and was impressed by the standard features the base model Accord has. I like the tightness of the suspension and the reasonably quiet ride. The transmission is smooth also. While I only have 1,000 miles on it I would highly recommend it to my friends. 

</DOC>

What can I say about this car, it is simply the best car purchase I've ever made. Was looking for something fun, fast, comfortable and practical and got it all with this car. Honda has stepped the Accord Coupe into a new market. I was torn between this car and the 350Z but chose the Honda for cheaper ownership costs and better practicality. I could not be happier with the performance and ride of this car. I'm worried I'm going to put too many miles on it but I just want to drive it all the time!!! Did I mention is looks absolutely beautiful in Belize Blue! I told my friends I bought an Accord, when the saw it first time none of them believed that it was an Accord. You'll love it!

This car is not at all fun to drive because of road noise and engine noise. I wonder why Honda overlooked this. If you are planning to buy this car and are concerned about engine and road noise think twice and do the road test carefully. Road noise is really irritating and annoying.

I am a self confessed car junkie. Have wasted many thousands trading cars too often. Have had new Acura RL, Acura TL, MBZ E55, BMW M3, Chrysler 300 SRT8, Infiniti M45 and most recently a BMW 550 w/sport pkg. I just got my Accord a few days ago and I honestly have to say it is an excellent car. Great fit and finish, tons of bells and whistles and it's a great value for the money.

I just traded in a 2008 Honda Accord 4cyl for this 6cyl, let me tell you it's night and day. The 4cyl was loud and a litte harsh, the 6cyl is a thing of beauty and the smoothness of it is unbelieveable. If you can afford it, definately get the six cyl. When you test drive these cars do yourself a favor and take both models out and you'll see what I mean. I bought the Exl version and it's perfect for all the features you get. The car rides beautifully but at the same time you feel the road. I've bought over 20 cars in my life and I can tell you this car is by far the best of all.

This is my first Honda and I'm loving it so far! The pick up is good but that 18.5 gallon tank lets you know when you accelerate. Getting about 20 mph and hopes that gets better. Wish the colors were better with matched with the interior and exterior colors offered. Where is the Navy or dark not Royal Blue and that is not Red that is Wine.

The new '08 Honda Accord is beautifully designed. The impressive thing is that the LX base model comes with many necessities like full side airbags, power up/down driver windows, 16" wheels and Dunlop tires, drive-by-wire throttle, double-wishbone and ind. multi-link suspension, and vehicle stability control. The passenger space is very roomy. However, the trunk is not as big as you would like in a large- size car. Additionally, the standard seats are not my favorite. I did try the CR-V and it felt better to drive, but my wife demanded elegance and luxury so we went with the Accord. It is such a beautiful car that I've only put 400 miles in three weeks. It is better admired than driven!

My first Honda, and I love it. The car achieves a nice balance between sportiness and comfort. Not as smooth as my Toyota and not as sporty as my old Passat, this car represents a nice middle point. The car is very roomy inside. The back seat is huge. Body styling is vastly improved. The sound system is terrific. The Handsfree link has been great for business trips. The navigation system is sophisticated and comes with a trip computer. The car has ample power, but the gas mileage has been disappointing. I'm getting about 17 MPG in city driving and 27 on the highway. The car has been terrific in the snow, a nice plus. A terrific value.

The new '08 Accord truly is a great car! First Accord ever, traded in a '91 Civic which still ran like new! Runs smooth, handles great, power is amazing! Hint: adding accessories will bolster appeal! Also, VIN number starting with "J" means made and built in Japan, where you can't go wrong! Trust it!

My 2008 Honda Accord continues to impress me every time I start the engine. There is an amazing comfort level with this car. Comfort based on the quality and attention to detail Honda efficiently packs into this newly reclassified full size car. Talk about your bang for a buck, you get it with the Accord. From the overall exterior styling, the leather interior, dashboard, moon roof, engine, wheels, tires, and even the trunk you get nothing less than quality. I am extremely happy with my purchase and because I hate to share this car with the wife I am now scrambling to realign my budget to make a move on the coupe or maybe just another sedan.

I'm a new owner of a 2008 Accord and it is one nice car. When I first tested the EX-L V6, the performance and handling of the car sold me- I had to get it and I did. The ride is very smooth, the suspension is a little stiff so you feel almost every bumps of the road but the noise level on highway is low. The interior is comfortable, neat and you can find everything within reach. There are plenty of space in the back seat and the trunk is big enough for all your needs.

The 190 hp 4 cylinder is plenty strong enough for most driving conditions. In typical Honda fashion, it likes to rev and gets downright entertaining at 4000- 7100 redline. My last two cars were "fast" (WRX, TL) and I got this because my family got larger. On occasion, I do miss the power of the aforementioned vehicles, but the transmission is up to the task. I like the grade logic control and it seems like a very intuitive transmission (knows what I want to do). Overall, I am very satisfied on all fronts. I prefer the nav joystick over a touchscreen for cleanliness. Additionally, the set back nav screen is nice, and within a quick glance of my sightline.

This is my very first honda accord and i love to drive this car. It has all the feature i was looking for in any other mid-size economy car. The interior is roomy, exterior is definitely better than BMW 3 series. I just filled my gas at 350 miles with little left in it. I drive both on highways/locals. The heated leather seat is very comfortable and audio system is rocking. In my opinion, Honda accord 08 EX-L (4I) model is definitely better than toyota XLE (4 cylinder) top line model. I would highly recommand this car to people not only for look but also for fuel economy since this gas pricing are booming!!

We picked up a new Accord LX the other day and we couldn't be happier with our purchase. Although it's a lower trim level, it has high quality interior trim; very comfortable seats; and and very smooth, quiet ride. The interior and exterior look great! Also, it's very spacious inside, but it doesn't feel big. My only complaints are the wheel covers on the LX look cheap (in my opinion), the trunk hinges invade some space, and there isn't a trip computer or compass. Other than that, this car is great! I recommend it to everyone!

I've only had the car about one week, but so far so good. I love the interior layout and comfort. The center console is a bit overwhelming at first, but it gets better as you get used to it. The navigation and bluetooth are awesome. Highly recommend getting that option if possible. The ride is smooth and quiet. I'm very happy thus far.

This was an un-planned purchase. I'd looked at the Mazda 3 and the Nissan Altima coupe. When I saw this in the Nighthawk Black Pearl I had to have it. I am coming out of a 2.8 VB Jetta so the 4-cyl is a little slow for me. Otherwise, its a great car. My only complaint is the seat is not comfortable for a long period of driving and if it is raining and you barely roll the window down uou will get soaked. This car is a real head turner. I get tons of compliments on it.

Went into the dealer to buy a Pilot and walked out with this beauty. This is my 5th Honda and by far the best. Honda has outdone itself on styling and performance. The car is as big and roomy inside as my old Acura Rl, handles better and gets better gas mileage.If you consider buying one get the V6. Worth every penny and not much difference in fuel economy. No issues with the car. Own a 07 GTI and had to bring it to the dealer for 4 separate issues with 3500 miles. Never had this with a Honda. Very roomy and comfortable even with 5 adults. Excellent value for the money

I have shopped around for months now, and nothing has been more attractive and financially appealing as my new Honda Accord coupe. I love the styling of it, it looks like a mix between an Acura TL and a BMW 3 series. It's fun to drive, and gets great gas mileage. I couldnt have asked for a better car.

Had been curious about the '08 since it came out; have been driving my wife's old 4Runner and wanted something with better fuel economy & smoother ride. My other option was a Jetta but after test drive this won hands down with the bang for the buck. I previously had a '01 Acura CL Type- S and the ride is similar; interior design not all that much different than the TL and on the EX-L you get most of the same options; plus the added roominess in the '08 helps w/ a family. Was able to get a Polished Metal w/ Gray interior right off the truck.

Just picked up this car yesterday and drove it about 150 miles - highway and city. I have been driving a 1990 Acura Legend Sedan, but also recently owned and driven a 2004 Accord V-6 Coupe and 2004 S2000. Moving to Manhattan, we kept the old car and sold the others. I have to say I am disappointed. The Acura STILL was a far sportier driver than this new car, too "Buick" like. It may have stolen its lines from BMW but it does not drive like one - this is NOT a driver's car. BEWARE former Honda owners, this car is now a Toyota Avalon. And you can DEFINITELY feel the engine switch modes.

The car is sexy as hell. I have it black on black with tints so the car is very appealing. The 3.5 has balls compared to the 07 models, They spiffed up the 08 with a lot of new nic nacs which is a big thing for honda. The car is a beauty.

After a brief break driving a PT Cruiser for 36 painful months I returned happily to Honda. It took one test drive and I forgot all about the Passat and Legacy I was comparing it to. The car is equipped just how I wanted (5-speed w/leather) and is less appliance like then my 02 Accord SE.

I love my new Accord. It is fun to drive and roomy. At 6'3" I can sit comfortably in the drivers seat and have an unobstructed view out the windows. Unfortuantely, I am a bit disappointed with the MPG. I use the highway extensively. Between town and the Highway I only get about 1-2 MPG over my former 2000 6cyl Accord. The best gas mileage I have achieved for this 4 cyl. has been 30 MPG on 250 miles of continuous flat terain highway traveling no higher than 68 Miles per hour mostly on cruise. Around town I am averaging about 17 MPG. For a 4 cyl. vehicle, I expected better especially since I drive conservatively. Bottom line - This is a great car but dont expect it to spoil OPECs bottom line

Have approximately 500 miles so far. No problems. Handles great, good mileage, and wonderful ride. Stereo sounds is excellent. XM is a real plus. Don't particularly like the daytime running lights. Would like to turn them off. However understand they are a safety item. Center instrument panel hard to read in bright daylight Was looking at new Nissan Coupe also, but purchased Honda because of larger interior.

Had a 2005 Honda Pilot EX which provided 15 MPG. With the price of gas going to over $3.00 per gallon I wanted something more fuel efficient but large enough to seat four adults comfortably and provide a sense of safety too. Honda always provided a quality product for the money so I drove a Civic EX sedan, the Accord EX sedan, and a CR-V. The Civic was too small. The CR-V's engine felt like it needed more horsepower. The Accord was quiet, was easy to drive, seemed to be the right size, and would provide decent mileage. First two tankfulls delivered 20 MPG. Somewhat less than I was expecting but 33% better than the Pilot. I have the car on a three year lease and am pleased with it.

Formerly owned BMW 3 Series, Infiniti FX and most recently 2006 Passat. After driving the new BMW 3, Lexus ES 350 and other more expensive sedans, decided on the Accord. From a value standpoint I could not justify spending $10+K more on other comparably equipped sedans. The Accord does everything well. Yes, the lux sedans are a bit quieter at highway speeds, but overall none can justify such a steep premium over the Accord. For the money this is without question the best value and can certainly be considered a "near luxury" model in it's new 2008 configuration.

I ordered this coupe in October and it arrived 2 weeks ago. From the moment I pulled out of the dealers lot...wow...excellent power and pickup. Even thought the roads had some ice on them I just kept driving. Cornering is excellent, handles better than the BMW 328xi I was considering (too expensive with expensive repairs).Stablity control is apparent, shift is smooth although the gear box is small, as compared to the SUV's I was used to driving. Brakes are sensitive and feel secure, no drift, but occ steering torque is apparent with some up shifting.

I bought the Accord as I felt it represented the best value in its category. Unfortunately, I have gotten off to a rough start. On the first morning it would not start in my garage and had to be towed back to the dealer. Turned out the battery had a bad core. While it handles the road very nicely, I am very upset with the hesitation I have experienced. When I accelerate from a stop or very slow speed, there is a hesitation about 40%- 50% of the time. The service manager took a ride with me and said that type of effect was normal for this transmission. In 35 years of driving, I have never experienced this with a new car and have not experienced it with my wife's CRV.

I drove Honda back in the early nineties and thought I would not return. The design until 2008 I though was just ugly. When I saw this at the auto show, I desided to consider it again. Shopped it heavy, and this is just the best value. I commute alot, so interior is important to me, and its leather is does not seem cheap (like others in this price bracket) and comfort is top notch. I got the EX 4 cyl. for I live in so cal, and the 6 is not necessary sitting in traffic : ). Decent accel, huge back seat for my kids baby seats/ large friends. Read reviews about loud engine sound... mine is quiet. Feels like a luxury car but for about 10 grand less (why buy Acura?), will not go back Toyota

Much bigger and better than our Accord '00 EX-L trade-in, which we loved. The xtra room is a bit wasted on us, empty nesters, but the Civic is too small. "Gliding" can best define the comfort and quietness of the ride inside. Driving is nimble with quick steering and smooth road feedback. Ample power is confidence inspiring; the heavier new car has better weigh/HP ratio than the old one. This trim is about right for us: we don't need moonroof, heated seats/side mirrors (we live in S.FL) of the EX-L. But all the safety eqpt. is the same. Some other STD features add true value. With the leather seats, comfort is close to EX-L's at a "best buy" price.

I have been in the market for a car for a while. Anyway, I test drove many cars including the Camry and Avalon. The Camry just wasn't the car I was looking for and the Avalon equipped with the options I was looking for was more than I wanted to spend. Anyway, I drove to the Honda Dealership and didn't realize they changed the styling of the Accord in 08. At first I thought somebody drove an Acura to the Honda dealership. I absolutely love the styling. It was the combination I was looking for, great look, good value, decent gas mileage, and Honda's resale value.

I bought the 2008 Accord 6 days ago, have put 300 miles on it, and so far, all I can say is...nothing! I'm so impressed by this car that I am speechless. The handling of the car around turns is amazing, the engine responds with the right amount of "juice" when I need it, plus I get tons of compliments on its looks. I seriously can't count the number of times someone has said, "when'd you get the BM-er?" Not to mention, I have already driven it through a snow storm, which ironically was the day I bought the car, and it handled beautifully! I have nothing but praise for the folks at Honda for hitting a home run on the 2008 Accord!

I had been looking seriously at getting a slightly-used (2005) 3-Series BMW for my next car. I wanted a nice, sporty every-day driver for under $30K. When my wife and I stopped by the Honda dealer to look at an SUV for her, I saw that they had an '08 blue Accord coupe V6, 6MT. I'm not a fan of the previous Accord coupes, but when I took the '08 for a test drive, I was quite impressed with the nice balance of handling, ride and, of course, the power of that V6 coupled with the manual tranny. After doing some comparison test-drives of other brands, I came back to that 6spd Accord coupe. Honda now has a real mid-size "driver's car."

This is our 6th Accord and the one I like the least. We traded in our 2004EXL for this 2008. I am quite disappointed. The car is very loud! The windshield wash barely hits the windshield but I am mostly disappointed in the gas mileage. I'm lucky if I get 23 MPG and 98% of my driving is highway. Aren't we supposed to be making improvements in this area? My 2004 was getting 28- 30MPG. Unfortunately, I regret buying this car.

I was not intially interested in looking at the 08 Honda Accord. The previous models were boring both aestically and performance wise. This model has totally changed my view of the Accord. People come up to me and ask what kind of car it is and if it's a European car.

Just got my new EX-L 6MT with Navi and I already love it. I have owned a Mustang, BMW and other sports cars and really they were no more fun to drive than this car. It's engine pulls hard and the disk brakes work smooth too. I love the Bluetood feature. It helps to stay connected to friends and family on the phone without having to give up the fun of the stick shift. This is the third Honda I have owned with the Navi and I do like this version with the knob better then the touch screen. It is easier to make minor adjustments without fiddling with the screen. I bought the red model just like in the photo spreads and it is a real looker.

After six weeks and 1100 miles I love this car more than when I purchased it. Please note that the EXL models are much more fun than the non-EXL and the V-6 with navigation is downright fun. I thought the non-EXL and the 4cyl, were a bit boring and actually felt like a Buick. Sorry, if you purchased one, just my opinion. I love the EXL-V6 with the navigation package. It is really worth the extra money. Fuel economy is not great, but not terrible. Driver's door is too far out at the top to serve as a left arm rest, becomes a problem on longer trips. Seats are a bit too firm for me. Some days the ride is excellent and others the bumps are felt right to the spine!

I love the car except for the rattles from the passenger side. I noticed the compartment under the glove box was not snapped shut properly so fixed that but it still rattles worse than my 2001 Nissan Sentra on certain road surfaces. Great handling and acceleration though.

Have owned several Honda Accords before and the new design was really interesting. One test drive convinced us it was a superb car for us, I am 6'1" and it has lots of leg room. Traded in a 2007 Hyundai Azera Limited that depreciated too fast for my comfort zone. The 2008 Accord EX-L with 190 hp 4 cyl is a powerful driving experience. It gave me 25.3 mpg on the 3rd tank of fuel over both city and highway driving. Leather seats are very comfortable. My car is silver with black leather. Exterior design is handsome and a decided change from previous years. Added color matching body side molding for extra protection from careless door openers. A really super vehicle.

Had to buy a new car...did my research and Accord kept coming back as one of the top performers in overall quality. Very happy with the car. I4 offers responsive acceleration - it's not a drag car car so have realistic expectations - buy a V6 if you really need that feeling. Interior is very comfortable w/ ergonomic design in mind. are there a lot of buttons? Yes, could they have made it simpler? Yes. but realistically is it hard to figure out? No. new coupe styling is outstanding. Must see in person to really appreciate. pictures don't do it justice. Radio isn't to bad just make sure you set the EQ to fit your music or it can get washed out. 6 cd changer is a nice treat, but the aux

I have owned many Honda's including the V6 EX 2004. This 2008 V6 EX has a ton more road noise and the everything just feels so much cheaper. In addition, I'm only getting 24 mpg on the highway. Overall I'm disapointed.

This is the first Accord that I have owned. I currently have not had any problems other than the vibration in the steering wheel at 60-70mph. i did not notice it until I was on a smooth road. Lucas was able to duplicate but not isolate the problem. Honda suggested to put 3k miles and bring it back. The vibration is still present. I only wish my wife would let me drive it more often

You guys are too harsh consult Honda owners. I have been driving Honda Accords since 1994. 1) They always had a noise issue (larger tires and a timing chain didn't help since now its more noisy BUT you get better handling and no timing belt replacements at 60K miles). 2) For those who have to change rear pads too early; You have to USE THE PARKING BRAKES to set the rear brake pads properly. The inside and outside pads should ALWAYS wear evenly (IF ONE PAD IS WEARING TOO FAST SOMETHING IS WRONG) 3) Always had stiff ride and seats.

I have had my EX 4 cylinder Accord sedan for 1 year now. It is my first Honda, and after reading these reviews, I had to say something! I absolutely love this car! I have a bad lower back, and the lumbar support on the seats is a life saver! I also live 3 miles away from work, and drive all city miles. I get 25 - 30 mpg, and I am a complete lead-foot! I do not know what these people are talking about saying it gets bad gas mileage! It is all relative to the way you drive!! If you need lower back support, must go with EX model at least! Will definitely get another Honda!

Only had the car for 6 months and the right rear inner pad needs to be replaced already. I bought the car brand new and now only has 14,000 miles. Honda is NOT doing anything about this known issue problem. If you google "2008 Honda Accord brake problem" you will see a thousand complaints about the defective brake system.

Third Honda Accord. Very happy with 2008 changes. Front seats much more comfortable. Like exterior touches that makes it look classier. Rides great as all Hondas. Enjoying the pearl white instead of the chalk white. Comfortable, good in snow, easy to drive... great.

</DOC>
<DOC>


Car rides great, good fuel mileage. My only complaint is about the rear brakes. Twice I had to replace them. The dealership service dept. Said that the rears wear out faster than the fronts. HOGWASH. Load is in the front not back. Real bad brake design pads are small. (front brakes still have lots of wear on them). WHAT'S UP!

</DOC>

After 16 years in a Camry I somehow purchased this Accord?? I've had it for a year and a half - feels like a hundred. Gas mileage is not as advertised - 25 mpg at most. A lot of road and tire noise on expressway. Sound system is poor - especially on expressway. Front end scrapes on inclines. Rattles in dash. The stiff ride accentuates every bump in the road. I feel jostled around and worn out after a short 200 mile trip. The driver-side seat is not comfortable. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


For those of you that have had rear brakes replaced at under 20K while the fronts have 11/32 or more what are you doing? A car is designed to use most of the front brakes to stop, almost 70% vs 30% rear. So whats the real problem. Honda's excuse is BULL, (NORMAL) My guess is that the rear emergency brake was never adjusted right from the factory thus inside pad wearing faster than the outside. Either way this is not normal and should be a defect and replaced by the factory. I drive 50K a year and had to replace the rears at 30K while the front had 11/32 left. For those that don't know 11/32 is new 2/32 in the min you should drive with. 11/32nd's show very little brake use at 50K.

I bought my Honday last May. Overall the 08 Accord is a solid vehicle with some minor annoying flaws. This car is very comfortable car to drive. It handles well and I don't fell any vibration when the car shifts gear. The LX Accord car is a very powerful car especially to be a low model Accord. This car have a easy time drive up hills and does not struggle like my previous car. The most annoying problem I have with the Accord is the noise problem. While driving on the interstate you can hear every time the engine revs up or shifts gears. While driving on the interstate with the window down, the wind makes an annoying sound as it bounce against the interior of the car. 

</DOC>
<DOC>


This car is beautiful on the outside but it leaves a lot to be desired once you take it on the road. The road noise is extremely load and when you turn up the radio to drown out the noise it makes it impossible to carry on a conversation. The ground clearance of the car is so low that it constantly scrapes underneath the car when going up inclines such as your own drive way. Honda will not and cannot do anything to eliminate these problems. Honda is not receptive to feedback, so my only option is to purchase another vehicle other than a Honda. I did give Honda a try based on their reputation, but that was in my case a mistake. I will never buy another Honda automobile again.

2008 V6 sedan has vibration in steering wheel at speeds of 65 to 78 mph. Test drove a 2009 after I purchased mine only to find the same problem. Honda Corp does not acknowledge the problem. Possibly the new design with the new wishbone suspension. 7 months after the initial purchase @ 13,000 miles I needed rear brakes. They put ceramic pads on the rear to replace the factory pads and only charged me labor. But if they covered the brakes under warranty than why did I pay labor. Because brake pads are warrantied only up to 7,500 miles? Let's see how long these brake pads last! This is my 6th Honda and my last. Each newer model has more problems than the last.

So much for Honda reliability. The tires which Honda has decided to equip there best selling car with are the worst rated for driving on snow and in wet conditions. The satellite radio cuts out constantly, the heated seats are barely warm, the sound system is pathetic and the brakes wore out around 15,000 miles (google it...there's lots of complaints). On top of all that the engine is completely lame...just not fun to drive at all.

We've had our 2008 Honda Accord V-6NAVL for over a year now. The dealership has been unable to correct the vibration and noise that occurs at certain speeds (e.g., 25 mpg, 35 mph, 45 mph). It seems to be a combination of the transmission upshifting too soon and the engine. The sound and vibration is very similar to what happens when a manual transmission is shifted into a higher gear at a too low rpm. The result is that the noise and vibration make the car annoying to drive at certain speeds. Love the car design inside and out. Hate the engine and transmission. Just waiting to dump the car after 2 years.

I purchased my 2008 Accord LX-S 2Door in January of 2008. The car is very sharp looking and has some nice size to it for a 2 door. There is an abundance of headroom without the sunroof, which I love. The 190-hp 2.4 is semi-quick, and good for daily driving. I have have had some problems fixed under warranty: 1. Trunk was misaligned from factory (fixed under warranty), 2. Tail lights were rubbing where they meet rear quarter panels causing paint chipping (fixed under warranty) 3. Trunk lid sometimes "clunks" when opening the car (not fixed yet). Gas mileage is OK, averaging about 23-24 city - 31 highway normal driving, I don't drive fast, but I don't drive slow either.

I have owned very high end cars and I am amazed at the expectations of some of these reviewers. This Honda is so fun to drive and very reasonably priced. A 20k car is not going to drive like a 50k car. My husband and I compare it to our old BMW. Of course, it has more road noise but so did the 5 series when we tested it. We are both tall, 5'11'' and 6'2" and have no problems with the seats. This is a great car for the money.

This is my first Japanese car. Great car to drive hold the road very good and steering is tight. After driving it for a few months I found the seats are tough on the lower back on long runs and it need a few more inches to go back. Fuel mileage is disappointing 15/18 city 22/26 hwy. winter/summer. Very cheap paint and clear coat very chip happy. Good thing it's leased for only 2 more years.

The car is well equipped but its a very noisy drive, especially when traveling on the interstates. The car was designed with a very low ground clearance which causes the undercarrige scrape when going up inclines.

Car looks great in coupe form. Would recommend to get the stick, as the automatic feels quite detuned. There is also a lag on acceleration, likely due to the VEM. 2008 models have many problem areas; rear brake premature wear at 20,000, improperly installed headlights and taillights causing paint chipping around the lights. Seats are too firm and leather is quite "hard" in character and feel. Lots of room, especially for the driver and passenger. Radio works great. Gas mileage not quite as good as advertised. Quality does not seem to be up to par as previous Hondas. Resale value for the V6 is unacceptably low. Rear window should have a rear wiper.

Driver seat could be more comfortable however, but I love everything about it. Gas mileage is above average. Mine is black, and just looks awesome.

Purchased Accord Feb 2008 V6 EX Cloth interior. Overall, it has been a very satisfying vehicle. I have 19K miles on it after a year. I really like the power of the V6. Very peppy engine. I have not experienced any mechanical issues thus far. I change the oil and perform the scheduled maintenance. I find the interior comfortable for short and long trips. My wife does say the vehicle is not as comfortable for long trips as other cars we've owned. A couple of downsides. The headlights aren't as bright as I would like. This should be fixed. Also, when the passenger windows are down but not the front windows, it creates a very strange frequency that hurts the ears. Overall a very good car.

All I can say is that I purchased this car thinking I was getting a quality car as I have done in the past. Forget it! The days of the Honda are over for me...Take it on the highway, the engine noise is so loud that its hard to hear people on the other end of your cell phone. And at the end of a long trip your ears are still buzzing with the sounds of road noise.... Honda designed a beautiful car, too bad the mechanics aren't on par with the design. I have had others before with no such problem. This one is a joke. I am getting rid of this car as soon as I can. Stay away from this one. Another friend of mine bought his at the same time and is selling his too.... Sorry, Honda you lost your edge

After several years of owning comfy but less than reliable VW's, I decided the time had come to take a crack at a new Honda. The new exterior design and ACE engineering really sold me on the car, as well as the standard features on the EX-L. I needed a smart looking, roomy, reliable family car that still made me enjoy my commute when the kids weren't on board. This car fits the bill. I opted for the EX-L as opposed to the EX-L V6 because at the time of purchase I wasn't sure what the future held for gas prices and a 190hp 4-cylinder seemed more than adequate for me. My only gripes with the car stem around the heated seat switches and the XM Radio.

Bought the 2008 Accord in July. Good running car. Good style and quality. Just did a round trip to Fla from MA. Comfortable ride no thanks to the comfort of the drivers seat!! Had to purchase an orthopedic back support for the driver side. It was worth the $100 bucks. Without it I was in pain! I suggest others complaining of same to purchase an orthopedic car back support to correct the problem.

Love this car! Loaded, except the GPS. Great power, great ride, and pretty good fuel mileage (I average 25 between city and freeway, and usually set the cruise on 80). When I go on highway trips I usually get around 28. Great sound system, huge trunk, and plenty of backseat room even for those 6 feet tall! Only complaints I have is the road noise, which is a little louder than I would like, especially in rainy weather (of course my previous car was an Audi A4), and of course it doesn't handle near as well in the snow/ice. Would I buy it again? YES!

I purchased my car less than a week ago and am very disappointed. It is beautiful and fun to drive, but first morning I got in, tire pressure light was on and all four tires were low on air. Three days later we noticed the rear center brake lights in center of window and spoiler weren't working. Tonight I find that my headlights, brake lights, and interior lights all flicker every 20 seconds when the air conditioner is running. This is an almost $30,000 car with less than 500 miles on it and shouldn't have problems. As beautiful as this car is, I wouldn't recommend buying one.

I'm a little over 6'1" and my Accord has tons of room! Very comfortable drive, holds the road very nicely and a blast to drive. Like every car there are things I would like to see changed but overall you can't beat the quality of a Honda. It has a lot of pep, really moves for a 4cylinder! You wont find a better car for the price.

I purchased my 08 Accord, March 08. Since that time I have had navi replaced, brakes started squeaking at 4k miles, I was told this was normal by dealership, maybe weather related, followed regular maintenance and complained about brake noise during service intervals total of 5 complaints, at 13k had to have complete brake system replaced. I have decided to the file a lemon law complaint. This process seems lengthy but I am very unhappy with this purchase. I should have stayed with my first chioce BMW. This is my 5th Honda and my last. Lemons are sour! yuck!

Chose this Accord after viewing several endorsements, mainly from Consumer Reports. Have owned a couple Hondas in the past and I still have an Odyssey 2002 that runs fine. Did not test drive it. The engine is fine, appreciate some of its newly design features. The inside is a total different matter. Rattles and noises showed up after a few days and it has been downhill ever since. I am not talking about expected noise levels, I wish! Sounds like the very structure in the inside has so many imperfections that you get a concert of annoying noises. I am losing money for I will change this car very soon.

Bought LX-P for 22000. I usually only bought buicks since 1995, but they didn't last. I drive about 36k miles a year. The Accord is a great car, quiet, and i wouldn't trade it for anything. Camry vs. Accord, hands down Accord, test drove both. The Accord is so large, comforting, and easy to understand radio system. I currently have 45k on the car, and no problems. I also own a '08 Sentra w. 31k on it, and the Accord would beat it in every way possible, any day. I got into an accident w. the Accord, a Jetta's brakes failed and crashed into me at 35 MPH. The Accord's bumper had some scratches while the Jetta had to be towed! Great safety. it is so good, i would recommend to my enemies!

Honda quality is not what they advertise it to be. They maybe at one time produced high quality engines but not anymore. My 2008 Accord EX-L V6 burns and consumes one quart of oil per 1000 mile. Their technical experts state that is normal. I definitely don?t recommend this car.

I've owned my car about a year. The ride is good but too much road noise. The engine has given me no problems other than lag time after the pedal is depressed. Gas mileage is at it's highest 24 mpg usually 22 mpg hwy. Interior is good but has quite a few rattles. Suspension is good. Handling predictable. Brakes have had rotors replaced due to vibration. There has been a click when placed in gear in the front CV joints no support from dealership. I bought a Honda because I've owned several that were great cars. This one has great looks but more issues than the previous.

Love this car! I was slightly concerned about all the reviews with the seats being uncomfortable. I love the seats-they are supportive. The car drives really well.

Let me start off by saying I love this car. I totaled my Mazda Protege 5 and spent the next 4 weeks comparing vehicles. With about 60% of my commute being freeway I am averaging about 27 mpg. This is by far the most comfortable vehicle I have owned.

Have been reading these reviews and I have same issue with dimming headlights. One dealer suggested it may be the power management system in these cars reducing alternator load to save fuel. Acts like engine cooling fan cycling, but also occurs at speed, below 20 deg. F with A/C off. Car has occasional no-start problem, like not getting fuel. Dealer checked and "unable to duplicate". Leased this car to get away from problems with an older car. Now issues are arising with the new one and no solutions. Very frustrating! Most disturbing is the large number of folks citing bad customer service. What happened Honda?!

When I bought this car a year ago, I initially wrote a review stating I may have buyer's remorse due to extremely uncomfortable driver's seat. I have now logged 51,000 miles and can give a very accurate review. Dealership replaced my driver's seat, made all the difference. Car averages 28 mpg overall, mostly highway. I have gotten as high as 31 on long trips, no air, driving 79 mph. Besides oil changes and tires, no unexpected problems. Cracked grille was replaced by dealer at no charge. Factory fog lights cracked, were replaced at cost. This car is very reliable, and driving it in Michigan's "blustery" winters has been nothing but sheer confidence. Overall driving experience A+.

I have had the car for 13 months. I am a bit disappointed with the interior planning. The heated seat button on the driver side is obstructed by the hand brake and the mode button to change the heating and cooling is at the farthest reach of the control panel. Additionally, it is puzzling that despite the purchase of an EX-L you need to get a v6 just to get something as simple as a universal garage door opener. I have had Hondas and Acuras in the past and there used to be a distinct difference from domestics, that isn't so for this model.

Not as quiet as a Lexus, but quiet enough. Not as cushy as a Lexus, but cushy enough. Not as fast as a 6cyl Lexus, but fast enough. Not as many bells and whistles as a Lexus, but plenty enough. But, almost $20,000 less, and that is very good enough. For the money, there is no better family sedan on the market. Most features are standard, and close enough to a luxury car, but for a lot less money. 15,000 miles in 6 months, and no problems to report.

I had been in GM truck leases for over 7 years, and was coming to the end of my 2005 Z71 Tahoe lease. Although I loved the Tahoe, I cringed every time I filled it up. I test drove the 2008 EX-L V6 coupe and love the handling and looks of the car, and entered into a 3- yr lease deal. So far, I am a definite fan, though I feel there areas that can be improved. Fuel economy is excellent on the highway, about 26-28 mph. Combined driving is in the low 20s. The VCM definitely helps the mileage - it was very noticeable when it activated in the beginning, but is barely detectable now, except for the dash indicator. At highway speeds, the interior remains quiet, with little to no wind or road noise.

This is my 3rd accord that I've owned in the past 5 model years. I had a 2003, a 2006, and now this 2008. The 2003 was a GREAT car. Little 4cyl 5 spd LX and it got awesome gas mileage. I then bought the wife a Honda Minivan, and traded the LX in on that. After about 6 mos I missed having an Accord, so I bought one for myself for my work commute. The 2006 was the 4dr EX V6 Manual 6spd edition. Got ok mpg averaging about 26.5-27.5mpg on my work commute which is about 85% highway. Bought this car and even on a 100% highway trip I couldn't get >26mpg. My work commute I get 22.5mpg. My 96 buick regal got 26-27mpg. Nice car but horrible MPG compared to ratings. Car maintained properly.

Love, love, love my 190hp. Was uncertain about going back to a smaller engine because I was coming out of a 3.4 6 cyl but I must say I have no regrets. I have owned my Honda for 7 months and once I got used to the engine and learned how to adjust my driving I find the engine very responsive. I have no problems with rattles and squeaks. The driver seat took some getting used to (I had back surgery several years ago) but I just had to adjust the back, the lumbar and then it was fine. My lights flicker some but it is so minor I had to just sit and stare to notice it. I was not in love with the rear end but added a deck lid spoiler and now I am happy with that look. So far so good!

I have been driving my 2008 Accord V6 for a year now. I previously had an 05 Accord Coupe V6. Suspension is improved significantly almost matching German cars as well as the overall drive quality in the new Accord. Much better handling and solid feel on the road. However I have few complaints about the interior. Although the dash looks really high tech, quality of the material used is not even matching my 05 Accord coupe. Some of the buttons make a cracky noise when pushed. It is the same for aluminum looking trim on door handles. These make the same kind of noise when door is pulled also look cheap. Manuel mode is a must on transmission. Still at this pricepoint, Accord is a great deal.
