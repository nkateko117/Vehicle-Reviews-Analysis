<TEXT>The Corolla is a good commuter car that will retain its value and last for years. It's cheap, honest transportation with a few bonuses like standard side impact airbags. The biggest drawback with the '09 Corolla is the steering. It's incredibly vague and drifts on the freeway. Looking back, I wish I would have leased the car with a manual transmission. At the time, there weren't that many on the lot. I love Toyotas in general. We also have an '87 Camry in the family. Service has been very good at our local dealer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great fuel economy, standard side impact air bags, external styling, Toyota reliability, overall quiet ride, easy-to-use controls, funky green color makes it easy to find in parking lots.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2009 Corolla LE has about 23000 miles on it and steers great and handles great. That wasn't always the case. The car used to steer like the front was toed in. The problem issues were that the car was out of alignment in the rear and the Goodyear Eagle tires. The rear axle of an LE is a "stamped axle" and has no alignment adjustment. I had to have an alignment shop modify the rear axle bolt position to bring the car into a correct factory assignment. Once that was done the car steers as you would expect and it gained about 2 miles per gallon in fuel economy. I also replaced the Goodyear Eagle tires which are not safe on wet pavement with Yokohama Avid Tour S tires. Now a very nice car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fuel economy is remarkable. I get between 33-39 mpg at 70 miles per hour. The inside cabin noise is very low, much quieter than a Civic. The purchase price is very reasonable. The car has great resale value and looks nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2009 Toyota Corolla LE since May 2008. I purchased it right after they became available at my local dealership, and traded my 2004 Corolla, which I loved. I fell in love with the redesigned body style of the 2009 model, but that's where the love ends! The biggest complaint I, and many other owners that I have talked to, have with the 2009 Corolla is the Electric Power Steering. I cannot, for the life of me, keep the car in a straight line when traveling over 50mph. I think that it is a design flaw that should get looked into. Other than that rather annoying and potentially unsafe aspect, the build quality is comparable with the 2004 model. Gas mileage is about 35mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM Radio inside the dash, Aux input for iPods, good gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Ugh!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is absolutely the most boring car I've ever owned. I've owned everything from sedans, to coupes, to convertibles, and trucks - this is the least inspiring car I could ever imagine to own. I drive a lot for work, and I just wanted something with good fuel economy and a reputation for reliability. I suppose it has that in spades, but that's all it has. In a practical sense, there is nothing wrong with the car. It does what it's meant to do, but I hate driving this car. I can't wait until I get rid of it. The engine is lifeless, and the steering and handling are non-existent. Boring, boring, boring, boring!! I will probably never buy another Toyota, and would never buy a Lexus either.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>None. It has an aux input, moonroof, alloys, etc...but those things are commonplace now-a-days. Again, nothing exciting. I really regret this purchase. I wish I would have bought a Civic or Mazda 3.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I like my Corolla. I chose a Corolla base on its reputation and Intellichoice.com recommendation. Along with the Civic, it has the lowest Total Cost of Ownership. The reason I picked the Corolla it was simply because Toyota gave me more for the money, alloy wheels, power locks and windows, etc. I am intending to keep this car for a few years so I bought extended warranty and paint and rust protection. Toyota could have worked on the interior a bit. The stereo seems cheap quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel efficiency. I get a special parking spot at work because of it. I am getting 31 MPG. Rides smoothly on the Hiway. Vehicle stability control works very nicely during snowy or icy days. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this car after the engine went on our 2002 Nissan Altima. Very happy with the styling, handling, etc. with the Corolla. Nice head room for my boyfriend as he is 6'2" vs. the Civic. Negotiated a great deal and even had the dealer put in leather seats and front seat heaters.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my very first purchase of a Toyota vehicle and I am simply amazed...by everything from the friendly and cooperative salesmen to the overall quality and value of this car. I was so impressed with this vehicle I actually found myself trying to find something not to like. I Thought to myself well this car cant be that good, can it? Well that is just nutty. This is the perfect car for me, in fact I look at it as a gift. I know that may sound a little strange or perhaps sappy but that is exactly how I feel, like it or not. Assuming Toyota continues with this level of quality and affordability, I will be a customer for life. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car overall our 5th Toyota. Fuel consumption is good about 5.5 litres/100km on long runs & 6.8 around town. Very sensitive steering. This is not a problem but does require more attention while driving or the car can be in the wrong lane very quickly. Have experienced a rumble/knock in front region of car plus rattles in sun roof. Dealer changed windshield thinking it was flexing body.This didn't solve problem. Dealer has just replaced a front strut & housing which has solved problem. Now we only have minor rattles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm very disappointed. I have had this car 11 months now, and my intermediate shaft has given out, my brakes replaced, rotators SHAVED, and intermediate shaft replaced. I have taken my car to the dealership 3 times and finally had them sit in car to listen before something was done about brakes. The recall is only in northern states for the brakes. Although all of the above has been done. Costing me time and no car during the days being fixed!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive 18 miles each way to work, and it's a pleasure to drive the Corolla. I like the instant mpg monitor. Even at 27 city 35 hwy EPA, I average 33 mpg, and hit 43.51 mpg on the highway over a 150 mile trip. I filled up, drove and filled again on return. It's very quiet for a compact, the stereo is decent, and I am beginning to like the electronic power steering a lot more. As it breaks in it is getting better mileage. I got the gray with gray window tint and its classy looking without adding anything to it. Brakes are great, haven't had it in the snow yet. Very little wind noise on the highway. Seats are comfortable, visibility good. Good rear legroom. Smokes the competitors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the MPG monitor and ext temp. I use the MP3 connector and the MP3 playing CD player constantly. Great trunk, can fit the bass amp in it nicely. Fold down seats, ABS, side airbags, awesome commuter. It's like a small Camry, how cool is that?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the car in September and already have over 1200 miles on it. Purchased it for the great gas millage and low price but I agree with other reviews that it is a very basic car and some of the features were poorly thought out like the center armrest and the clock. However for the money this is a great car. It takes some getting use to the electronic power steering but for a 1.8 liter engine there is lots of pep in this car. I am averaging 33.5 MPG so far and overall am pleased with the purchase. The best news was that the dealer was extremely anxious to deal on price ? way better price then the TMZ price. In addition, the zero percent financing sealed the deal!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the look, great fit & finish, auxiliary jack for iPod or satellite radio, lots of room for a small car, split folding rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for an old man's car when I bought this one. From that perspective I couldn't be happier. I've got a dealership installed leather option called a Platinum package. The electric power steering is reminiscent of the old (50's) luxury cars and I love it! One finger steering at idle! I only have 1700 miles on it but am seriously impressed. The lack of styling is disappointing, reminds me of a '51 Willys sedan, but I didn't buy it to impress anyone. The interior is comfortable and quiet. I had a 2008 rental for a couple of weeks, and this is much better (I wouldn't have bought a 2008 model. I've had 2 Toyotas, a 1970 Corona MKII and a 1987 pickup. They were both rock solid reliable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>38.9 MPG. Do I need to say anything else? I travel 30,000 highway miles annually and since purchasing the 2009 in July of 2008, the LE is providing great fuel economy, reliability, technology and above average comfort. The only design flaw is the lack of proper location of arm rests for the drivers seat. This really comes in play on the highway; not as much in the city. Suggestion: If you log the high miles, purchase the bumper-to-bumper package. For the additional $700.00 it will pay itself off in the off-chance this Toyota has a major mechanical failure.

<TEXT>I've owned just about every car made over the years. I needed a car that got great fuel economy and didn't look like an egg going down the road. The Corolla S looks great, runs great, and I average over 40 mpg on the freeway with my 70+ mile commute every day. The new 2009 interior is comfortable on the long drives, much better than the 2008. I like just about everything about the car and the price was more than fair for something that I know will last me over 200k miles with no problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving this car is actually a lot more fun than people give it credit for. Yes it is an economy car but it can get up to speed quickly enough to pass other cars. It has a very sporty look (even at the LE grade) and generally doesn't look like every other car on the road. The electronic power steering takes some getting used to but overall I haven't had a bad experience with this car. Gets great gas mileage on the highway in my opinion. I drive mostly mixed hwy/city driving and so far the best I've gotten is 35MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased our new 2009 Corolla to do some extensive traveling. We find the car excellent in the city, but on the highway it is terrible. The car is uncomfortable - seats, armrests, lumbar support, left foot positioning, blind spots. The worst problem is a vibration at highway speeds that the dealership says is normal. We are so disappointed in our new Corolla and are considering dealing it at only 3000 kilometers.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Since our 99 'Civic was totaled while stopped at a red light, I decided to look around at other brands of cars: After examining everything on the market, I bought a new 09' Corolla LE. Why? Toyota's reputation for reliability is seldom matched, and competing brands weren't outstanding. It's a solid feeling car that performs as well or better than almost any other economy vehicle. The mileage is superb: with about a half-and-half mix of heavy town traffic and mountain driving, it has averaged 35.8 MPG! Much better than advertised. I don't shove my foot through the gas pedal, but it keeps up with traffic just fine. The "Hot Car" magazines may pan it, but average drivers will be happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> This car was a demo, and has everything: sunroof, cruise control, VSC and all the other goodies. Everything works as advertised. The car has a timing chain rather than a belt, which saves big bucks in maintenance costs. It has Variable Valve (VV2) timing on BOTH camshafts.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my 2004 LE to buy this 2009 LE. This is my 4th Corolla since 1993. I have always found the newly designed models to have things that I enjoyed more than the old ones - until the 2009. I still respect the reliability, the no-frills, down to earth, never-break-down-at-3AM Corolla experience. It is basic, solid transportation. We all know that. The 09 looks sleek and nice and it is, until you get inside and you wonder who fell asleep at the wheel, literally. The armrests are useless, the CD holder spaces are gone, the coin tray is so tilted all the coins fall out, the wood grain is gone on the LE, the knobs look outdated and the interior looks cheap and flimsy. What were they thinking? </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a typical Corolla... plain, boring, reliable. It's a great appliance for getting from point A to point B. There is nothing that makes me smile while driving this car, other than knowing it is much more reliable than my GM cars and truck and gets excellent mileage per gallon. If you want a car that does the job without a lot of fuss, one that doesn't draw attention, negatively or positively, then this might be the car for you. If you're looking for a thrilling driving experience, this is not it. We got exactly what we wanted with this car- no hassles and reliability. After being a GM owner, those are wonderful things to have in a car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is awesome! It's durable and reliable! I feel so comfortable and safe while driving in this car! The seats are super comfy, the outside look of the car is hot, and it handles well - around turns, speeding up quickly, etc. I shopped around for a new car for quite some time and I'm very happy with my choice. It's great for the money - great on gas, great look - worth every penny!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>How the stereo volume goes up automatically when you step on the gas/going a certain speed - and there's different levels, low, mid, and high. The windows go all the way down in the back!!! There's no hump on the floor of the back seat = extra room for backseat passengers!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my new 2008 Toyota Corolla S (red) a few days ago. I was looking for a new car, but didn't know what I wanted. I was looking at Honda, Nissan and Toyotas. I test drove an 08 Toyota Corolla and didn't like it. When I saw the 09 Corolla S, it looked real sharp! The car was smooth riding and looks sporty. This car really turns heads!! In case you're looking at the car colors on toyota.com, the colors online don't do the actual color justice. I was skeptical of the red when I found out that's the car the dealership found for me. But when I saw the car in person, it looked totally different than what that what I saw on Toyota's website. You won't be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have just had our Corolla for three week but my wife and I really like the car. We just returned from out first road trip and averaged 38 mpg! Our first tank of gas with city driving got 29 mpg. The car is very quiet, handles great and is fun to drive. We were looking for a balance of safety, fuel efficiency and reliability. We tested the Civic, Mazda 3, Hyundai Elantra, and a number of midsized cars. We also liked the Honda Civic but being 6'3" I felt I had more room in the Corolla. Yes, the electronic steering is a tad sensitive but we got use to it very quickly. With over 30 million Corollas sold world wide, it is now the best selling car in the world.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 5600 miles with 4500 of those on vacation and road trips i can say that this 09 Corolla is worth a look at. The steering is not what some say you get used to it in fact it feels better than our 00 Lexus RX300 to me. I have had 6 new cars since 1998 (3 Hondas, 1 Subaru 2 Toyotas) and this is a good value. I am 5-11 210 lbs and the ride on trips is great the MP3 is great I am getting 32-38 and it is not even broken in. I have a friend that has a 2003 he put over 300k then sold it now has a 2006 with 110k and no issues. He gets over 40 mpg all the time on the hwy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Solid car with great looks and performs flawlessly. I have a Camry and didn't need another large car for me to go to work in. This has a lot of bells and like them all. Drives great but don't really like the steering, maybe wider tires will help, you have to correct a lot while driving straight. Brakes work well but have more brake pedal travel than I like. Liked the car so well I decided to sell my S and ordered an XRS. No problems selling my 09 and getting a very good price for it. Just waiting on my XRS now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 48, and have driven many cars in my life. But after 5500 miles, I can say none that were this uncomfortable. And I like Toyotas! The tilt wheel won't go low enough, the arm rest is too far back (right), or just worthless (left), the steering wheel isn't open on the bottom so you can't hang your hand there. The car gets blown all over the road in crosswinds, and that with electric 'no feel' steering makes you look like a drunk driver on a windy day. Get 34 mpg at steady 75 mph, 29 around town in mixed driving. Good seats, good stereo, excellent cruise. The car rolls a lot in turns, but rides very nicely. Great for short trips, wouldn't recommend for long trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The design of the 2009 Corolla Sport model leaves a lot to be desired. First, they do not offer intermittent wipers at all in this model which was a shock. The head rests on the seats lean forward and your head is up against the headrest. The front seats do not go back far enough so you are cramped. The clock is not separate anymore. There is a button you have to push 7 times to get back around to the clock, located behind the wheel to the left. Look before you buy a Sport model. Do not assume that normal options come in every model. I love Corollas but I hate the Sport model. It's still fun to drive but I can't get comfortable. I prefer driving my mothers 2006 Corolla. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Corolla for two months now, it did 25.8 mpg city with a heavy gas hitter. The trunk has room for all my golf clubs and the split seat works well for my fishing rods. The placement of everything is logical accept the clock. The center console is a bit small along with the little compartment with the outlet. The plastic does scratch easily leaving marks. Everything feels solid nothing loose and feeling like it would break. The seating position can fit all, I'm 5'11 with long legs and it's really comfortable. If your looking for an economy car that gives you the most bang for the buck, this is it. A very big improvement from last year's model.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The aux jack for my iPod. Love the comfortable seats. The car looks really cool and sharp. The interior looks good for the money. The handling is superb.

<TEXT>This is without a doubt a great car! The ride is smooth and quiet, and I am averaging about 31 mpg on mostly highway miles. The transmission shifts great, and the JBL/XM radio/stereo is a blast. Oddly enough though, it ejects a CD and then shuts off once in a while for no reason. The dealer said that this could be caused by using colored or labeled CDs (makes sense), but this happens even when using the FM or XM radio too - weird. Also, the roof is leaking and during rain water is coming though the inside of the A pillars into the interior. But overall this is the best car I have ever owned and assuming they can fix the roof leak I will definitely buy a Toyota again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Toyota and I am delighted by the way it drives (hwy or city). Very economical and a joy driving a manual once more. Toyota makes it easy for young or old (me) it is a fun vehicle that can kick when you need it to. It has all the small details anyone needs from clock, MPG, outside temp. gas mileage from trip to trip and many others. You name it, it has it, and the one I bought was the simple package with no options what so ever. On the freeway it is comfortable and a delight to the wallet (37.9 MPG) in the city 29.8 mpg. It has 2,100 plus mile on it now and I doubt I will buy another car. If I do, it'll be one like this one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because I drive a total of 60-80 miles a day, stop and go, on and off engine city driving. My first choice was a Prius but the wait period is up to 6 months. It is overpriced plus marked-up price by the dealers made me change my mind. Then I saw this beautifully designed S. It is very easy to drive, has roomy interior, less road noise, comfortable sport seats, and my 2 boys think it's a cool car. With my daily driving pattern of 95% city driving, gas mileage on my first fill up was at 26 mpg. Computation was based on total miles driven from last fill up divided by total gas pumped, and not based on mpg computer on the dash board. I'm expecting mpg will increase later on</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2009 Toyota Corolla LE May 31, 2008. At about 2000 miles the VSC Light came on flashing. Took it back to dealer and they could not find anything wrong. The light came back on and it started to spit and sputter and die for no reason around 3000 miles. Took it back to dealer and they replaced the Mass Air Flow Sensor and cleared the codes again. Was driving it again and slowed down to turn a corner and it died for no reason. It currently has 4500 miles on it and the dealer has had it for a week. They called and said they are ordering a new wiring harness which is supposed to fix the problem. I'm now wondering what will be next.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's fun to drive when it is running like it should. Like the mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just traded in a 1998 Grand Am for this baby, thought we were going to buy a Civic, but once we saw the new Corolla and how sporty and roomier it is, we were sold. The dealership was ready to negotiate and met us at our price including more options. The black interior is warmer than my previous tan, but opening the sun roof clears out all hot air in about a minute. The A/C cools down real quick. 3 days after we purchased we took a road trip to Marquette, Michigan from Chicago. We had no problems at all. We love the sporty look, aggressive body style, easy to clean black interior, smooth ride, and I can almost see the front of the car! (I'm short!) We love this car and Toyota now!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy steering, easy to use radio system, great gas mileage in our city, which is ridiculous, is averaging 30+ weekly! Yeay!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2009 Toyota Corolla S and being 6' 3" there are few things that are making my ride uncomfortable. There is a foot rest for your left foot (drivers side) that juts out bending your leg into an uncomfortable position. Also, because I have the seat all the way back and at it's lowest position the weight of my legs is falling on the heel of my foot making my hour commute to and from work everyday a bit uncomfortable. I regret purchasing this car only for the comfort reason. Everything else is fine. I sure a shorter person would be very comfortable in the car but I'm not.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather interior, moonroof, sight lines are very good, acceleration is decent. Overall of a good car for a shorter person.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had been looking at buying a Ford TX, but mpg wasn't any better than my 16 yr. old car. Had owned a Corolla 10 years earlier and decided to try again. Test drove a S model and knew immediately this was the car for me! Getting 29-30 city/35 highway so far- only/2700 miles on car. Have rec'd lots of compliments on the style, interior and color (metallic charcoal). Had windows tinted which not only saves on fade on the black interior, but also adds to the sleek exterior. Steering a bit too nimble at times. Had read reviews about clock position, so expected this minor inconvenience. A bit hard to see when reversing - maybe backup sensors as option in future? Best decision ever made!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Boomin' stereo system, sleek exterior design. GREAT night time vision- headlights are awesome! Spoilers, sunroof, mpg, overall reliability, storage compartments and trunk space</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it as a fuel efficient alternative. I am averaging 41mpg. Very comfortable and fun. Though I dislike how they did the clock. I now have 2700 miles on it. I got the base model, not a single option, and was pleased to learn A/C, ABS and auto-on lights were included, along with a CD player radio (with headphone adapters). Well worth what I paid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research online. I test drove the Corolla S 09, 08 Honda Civic, and 08 Honda Accord. The Corolla has everything! I bought a Classic Silver 2009 Toyota Corolla S with the JBL option, moonroof, sport package. I love it, its been amazing. Getting around 34 mpg (mainly commute on a parkway to work). I feel like it is an economy car with some style. Trunk size is great, almost as big as my 1999 Taurus. The clock display is not that bad, takes time to get used to. Go buy it if you can find one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>JBL w/bluetooth, moonroof, spoiler, interior. Many places to put things, top-bottom 2 glove compartment. plenty of backseat space. Love the style of the interior and exterior. I really don't have a thing that I don't like about it. Contact me if you have any questions</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I upgraded from a 1998 Malibu, which gave me fits for reliability, but interior was much better: the power mirror adjustment on the Toyota is on the dash and difficult to reach when driving; arm rest on the driver left is not usable so you have to rest your arm on the window ledge, the arm rest on the right is too far back; the clock is tucked into driver's instrument panel and tiny; and none of the cup holders have liners to take out for washing. In general, the interior is just flat out cheap. On the upside, the readouts for gas usage are terrific, the car runs great, and looks good. Just wish Toyota had spent the extra few dollars on the interior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very reliable, superb gas mileage, and the mpg feedback readouts help that immeasurably.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was going to get a Yaris sedan. My wife just got one and I really liked it, but there nowhere to be found. Glad I tried this baby. I traded in My 2001 Mustang that was in great shape, but the winters are getting tough for me to drive and also gas prices so it was a tough thing. But it took me 2 days of driving this car and I love it, not quite the pickup the mustang had but who cares. The steering that people are complaining about is touchy but you do get used to it, no biggie to me. I love the look both inside and out (Black pearl). MPG avg is 41 mostly highway but a little mix</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased our XLE in April of 2008. The whole family loves the car from my 18 year old son, 19 year old daughter to 48 year old parents. The kids really enjoy the MP3 and iPod capability, push button start, automatic lights, and general style of the car. As parents we really are enjoying the gas mileage, comfort, and quiet ride of the car for the price. The car definitely delivers value for money. The car has no problem cruising at 70 mph on highways and with four drivers it is on the road continuously. Would definitely purchase this auto again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for about a month now and it has been really good for most of it, except mpg goes down way too much when I use A/C and I use my A/C on low not on max, both for highway and city unfortunately!

<TEXT>It's a nice car. I bought the White S model. Performance is a bit on the weak side for get up and go. Very nice interior and nicely detailed. Electric steering a bit touchy on highway and hard to make the car go straight after without touching the wheel. You can plug in the iPod into the auxiliary jack. So far it's turning a few heads as there is a 7 week wait for delivery and not many on the road yet. So far 444 km and 1st fill was 48.00 at 132 a litre so it's not too bad on fuel. I like the computer that tells you how many miles you can still travel on your fuel, this is a nice roomy commuter car with some class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2009 Corolla LE about 8 weeks ago and have been very happy with the purchase. The car came with many features, like automatic headlights and programmable door locks, that we would have expected with a much more expensive vehicle. The car is used mainly for running around town and short trips. While the car is comfortable for short trips, I am not sure I would take it on trips of more than 2 hours one way because the seats seem uncomfortable after driving for extended periods of time. We have been making fewer stops at the gas station as we are averaging just over 36 mpg. Overall, I would definitely recommend this car to anyone considering a small fuel efficient vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It has some things I like, looks nice in Barcelona Red, and has good mpg, I avg 31-35 in 50/50 city/hwy but only have 4000 miles on it. I am 6'5" and the dash/tower digs into my right leg just below the knee. The JBL/XM audio kicks, the steering wheel controls are nice, but there is an awful lot of plastic everywhere. An anniversary edition car? It seems like Toyo cheapened it up too much on the inside. Too much flat black plastic that shows every little scratch. When I go thru a car wash, the air blast at the end flexes the roof to the point where I think it is going to be dented inward after every wash, so far it hasn't. Drove XRS is fun, but not the mpg. Lets see what winter brings? </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in our 2002 Monte Carlo SS two weeks ago for this Corolla S. My main motivation was gas mileage. I didn't expect to find a car that can get 35 mpg and zip up the mountains where I live. I carpool with my wife to work 35 miles each way and it is a comfortable, quiet ride. The car has enough power to climb the hills and handles great through the back roads. I thought I would be sorry letting the Monte Carlo go, but with the S I can still "play" when the mood hits. Oh, my wife almost got a speeding ticket... over 100 mph! Thank goodness the highway patrol was busy with someone else! If this car lives up to the Toyota name over the next 7 years, as I expect, I'll be very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the looks of the S package. The interior has a nice and sporty feel. Overall price for performance is very good. Lights are extremely bright and cover the area you need when driving dark back roads. Brakes are exceptional. Oh, did I mention the 35 mpg!?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just bought this car to replace our minivan. We have two kids and realized that we don't need the that big of a vehicle and wanted to save gas instead. Who cares about 0-60 performance? Who buys a family sedan to drag race it? For us, the 1.8 liter performs perfectly fine around town and on long trips. The gas mileage is fantastic and, compared to our minivan, was worth the price of admission. So if you want a good, comfortable, reliable, safe, and economical car to haul your family around this car is the one for you. If you want a sports car then buy a sports car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for two days now and its great. I am averaging 35 mpg with about 65% city driving. It doesn't take the bumps in the road as well as I had hoped (it takes them similar to my 00 Tacoma). The 09 just looks a whole lot better than the older models. Its got the redesigned front and fancier lights. The display on the dash for clock, mpg, range, should have more than one display. You can't see what time it is unless you have it on clock. In which case you can't see mpg, range, etc. Overall I am very happy with my new car. These cars are flying out of the dealerships so get one while you can!</TEXT>

I love how wide the car is, my wife and I have a 2004 S Corolla and this is a different car all together. I love the steering and the ride but the brakes should've been 4-disc versus drum.

<TEXT>If you want to save on gas but still want to buy something that's has some style to it, this is your car. I loved the redesigned look of the latest Camry when it out, and this new 2009 corolla is like a smaller version of the Camry. The exterior of the S model is beautiful in person, most pictures don't do it justice I think. The interior is nice and there is plenty of room for a family of five. Myself, my wife and our 3 girls (one who is still in a safety-seat). The JBL stereo upgrade is well worth it, it sounds great with plenty of deep bass, and the added Bluetooth support that comes with it is a God sent.

<TEXT>I am a long time Toyota owner and a first time Corolla XRS owner. I am a male in my late 20s and for how agressive and clean the car looks, the name evokes a complete opposite response from people. Everyone thinks it is a weak chick mobile. I wish Toyota would keep the platform, change the name and market the car more like the Civic. Anyway, the bottom line is I wanted a car that got great gas mileage, carried 5 passengers, has decent speed, is reliable, and looked good. It was the smart choice due to unforeseeable gas prices, but unless your friends, family, or peers know what the new XRS looks like, they will think you drive that old school rollerskate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Airbags galore. I also like the extra horse power over the stock. It is more noticeable at speeds between 0-30 mph and 70-100 mph. I don't know exactly why? Maybe the 30-70 mph is the mpg sweet spot and they toned it down in that range. I test drove the S in automatic for comparison.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I have 1000 miles on this 09 Corolla. The fuel mileage so far has been 33 mpg. The car feels very tight with no rattles or squeaks and it rides pretty good on the highway. The car is very quiet with little wind and road noise and the engine is quiet which gives this car a high quality feel. The brakes feel good and the trunk seems roomy. The paint is very nice and looks quality. The steering feels too touchy and it takes constant correction to hold a straight line at highway speeds. If I would have known about this steering flaw I might not have bought this model. Take a long test drive and decide for yourself before you buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great fuel mileage. Nice quiet ride. I really like the body style and the compact radio antenna, looks quality The dual glove compartments is nice and so is the keyless entry.

<TEXT>We traded in my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited V8(loaded). I loved, no, cherished, that car, but due to a long commute, we grudgingly began looking at Civic, Elantra, Focus, Fit and Yaris. After 2 months of test driving, comparisons and negotiations, decided on the Corolla S. I fully expected to feel disappointed driving it, but you know, it's actually fun to drive! And it's a great looking car too! We got the under and rear spoilers, alloy wheels and the sporty dark charcoal interior with blue accents (MUCH more attractive than the standard ash or beige velour) We are getting 38.5 MPG average (60% hwy/40% city) I don't even miss my Jeep! Happy with our choice!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked it up today. Traded in my previous gen Camry. Needed a better gas mileage car for 100 mile daily commute. I owned a 94 corolla in college and this model is many leaps ahead. Firstly the cabin is almost as quiet as that of a camry, even at high speeds. Build quality is amazing, very solid. Got 30 mpg in my first 150 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Toyota and I'm very glad to bought it! It's a blast to drive. My job requires about 5-6 short trips per day, so mostly city driving with some highway miles daily. I am consistently getting 37-38 mpg and just loving that! I can't wait to go on a real trip with the highway miles and see what I get. I am thrilled with how quiet it runs. You can stand right next to it and wouldn't be able to hear it running. Best car I've ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my '02 Taurus (which stink) for the '09 Corolla. So far I enjoy this car. The seat fabric on the S model is really nice. I have a dog and it is easy to vacuum. I drive mostly highway and so far with about 1000 miles I have gotten 34.5 MPG according to the car's calculation. One suggestion I have for all new owners is to immediately armorall the plastic on the interior of the car. It scratches pretty easily but the armorall takes care of that and makes it look a lot better! I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have around 900 miles on my new S and have to say am pleased with my second ever Toyota (first was a 2000 Tundra). I traded a 2004 Jeep Liberty that only got 15 mpg. Performance of the 1.8L is snappy and it sips the 89 octane, which is the real reason I bought it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned many toyotas, and traded in a 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid to but the new LE Corolla. Why did I do this. Close to the same gas mileage, more fun to drive and about 1/3 lower payment. First, I helped a friend by one, then a girl I dated, liked it so much I got one myself. Definitely a high value purchase, solid on the road, maneuverable, and low cost to operate, considering gas mileage and inexpensive tires. I feel this car is the best for the $ out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving the Matrix, Scion xD and Honda Fit, I chose the Corolla. For some 1.8 is small but that small really comes to live. The mileage is great and with gas prices being what they are now, I save money. Last vehicle I had gave me 16 city 18-20 hwy. This Toyota is giving me 28.8 city and 36 hwy. Bought it 8 days ago and I have loved every minute of it! It is a great car at a great price and superb gas mileage, and it is almost the same size as a Ford Taurus. Roomy, comfortable, plenty of leg room, huge trunk, and for the young ones reading this, an excellent radio/cd system, that delivers superb sound, and I did not buy the model with all bells and whistles either!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a pretty nice car. I bought this car because the predicted reliably. It is pretty fun to drive. The best improvements from the 08 is the remote is built into the key and has a button to open the trunk. also it can calculate the MPG. It has a little more horse power not much but noticable. The stereo sounds much better than 08. It is one of the most reliable small cars in history, that's why I bought it. My only complaint is it is only available in sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is fun to drive for what it is. It is very roomy on the inside compared to other vehicles we tested. I thought to gas mileage would be better though. I understand the EPA ratings are "estimates", but I travel 70 highway miles per day and so far am averaging on 26 miles per gallon. This seems a bit off the 35 miles per gallon on the sticker. Since this was the primary reason for buying this vehicle I am disappointed in the variance in what is advertised.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at getting a second hand luxury car but wasn't thrilled about the insurance costs, mileage to the gallon, and the lack of warranties. The older Corollas are not for me. I'm 25 years old, had to make a smart purchase but still an eye candy, fun to drive car. The XRS 2009 is amazing in every aspect, and there aren't that many out there, so yours will stand out more. Bottom line a Corolla hater (2008 and earlier) is now a Corolla lover. Test drove a dozen new cars, XRS wins by landslide!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is very spacious (I'm 6'3", 220 lbs), the gearbox is sexy, full sport package (everything you can want is included), Tiptronic is a dream (don't bother getting manual because this is a FIVE speed automatic!), blue color is young, fresh, unique, aggressive exterior look, very comfortable</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a little disappointed by the quality of the interior materials and some of the design decisions. I can't quite get the right seat/steering wheel setup, the LCD displays are hard to read in sunlight, and the electric power steering is atrocious. It's been 30 years since I've driven a car that required so many steering corrections. Engine performance is OK in first gear, a dog in any other gear. The ride/handling trade-off is surprisingly good for such a cheap car. Maybe I'm spoiled, by my 2006 Pontiac GTO has a much nicer interior than either this car or the Camry - surprising since everyone talks about how bad GM interiors are.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased for increased MPG, as my new job now requires me to drive several hundred miles per week. I did close to six months worth of research before deciding on the 09 Corolla. I have had this vehicle for about one month and 1400 miles. I have had a blast tested it in mixed driving, all city driving as well as all highway driving. My resulting MPG are much better than the advertised sticker ratings. Mixed is 35 MPG, city is 33 MPG and highway is 40 MPG. I was a little worried about going from my large SUV to a low riding economy car but the transition was easy based on great styling, ease of driving and of course the increadable MPG. Bottom line, you can't beat the fuel economy.</TEXT>

I have the regular model and it has all of the features that the other models do except it does not have power windows. The engine is strong for a 1.8 liter and has ample pull with a smooth transmission. I love the color I got; its called Capri sea metallic which is a nice light green metallic and I have beige interior. The gas mileage is excellent. I'm averaging 38 mpg</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for a few weeks. However, very disappointed in the windsheild wipers. If I would have known this, I wouldn't have purchased the car. The left hand wiper shimmers at the bottom; brought it back and was told they can't fix it. Another major issue is that the right hand wiper makes a line smack in the middle of the driver's viewing. I just got back from driving in the rain and it was dangerous. The line distorts viewing. I'd say this is a design flaw in the placement of the wipers and the wipers themselves; buyers beware!</TEXT>

<TEXT> I picked the 09 Corolla LE after test driving the 2009 Civic, Mazda 3 & Elantra models. The engine is lively for a 1.8, and it delivers the high mileage as advertised. It costs me (at current fuel cost), $50.00 to fill up and I get about 400 miles per tank.It was the least noisy and fastest of the sub compacts I test drove. It's lightweight so keep both hands on the wheel if it's windy on the freeway. Responsive steering and fun to drive. </TEXT>

It's no slouch when I get on it and I feel totally comfortable with the handling and ride of the car. The JBL stereo system with XM is also a nice touch. I can't wait for the aftermarket stuff to come out for this car, hopefully TRD doesn't short change us on that.

<TEXT>I could not be happier with the new Corolla. I am pleasantly surprised with the XLE trim. Here is my summary: Overall feeling: it feels like a upscale sedan with all the bell and whistles while still getting over 30 MPG. Ride: the ride is very smooth. A lot less noisy than previous models. Steering is very sensitive, perhaps a bit too much. Interior: the car is a lot more spacious than previous models. This trim looks elegant. Other features: very nice Bluetooth system, voice activated dialing, dial by number. Very good sound and XM radio. Lots of storage space. Huge trunk. I feel like I am riding in a mini-Camry. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car about 2 weeks and 400 miles and so far I love it and am still discovering things about it! It's quiet and has a very smooth ride. The moonroof is cool, as is the satellite radio and 6-CD changer. It's very comfortable to drive and feels solid. The interior dome light comes on when the key is turned off. The running lights get brighter as the environment darkens. The power windows remain operable for a minute or so after the key is turned off for those of us who habitually forget to close the windows before turning off the car. The trunk is roomy and even has a place to set things so they won't fall over, like a gallon of milk. It's Toyota quality and innovation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I've only had my XRS for a few days now; however in that brief time I've found it to extremely fun to drive, very comfortable and I'm disabled so to me that's saying something. Power is good for the 2.4l but it's not my first experience with that particular engine I have a Tacoma Pickup with the same engine (115,000 mi) not a lick of trouble. Mileage is great, 115 mi so far and hasn't moved off of the Full marker in all city driving. Fit and finish is as good as any other I run across. Overall it's my third Toyoa and I must say I look forward to many happy miles down the road.</TEXT>

We love the fact that it gets double the mileage compared to our Maxima. It's cute and fun to drive. It's nice that the floor in the rear is not divided so it's comfortable for three rear passengers.

I?m a little biased because I previously owned a Camry so I?m not yet used to the Corolla getting whipped around in gusts of wind. The touch screen navigation is a great option for the compact car. I was concerned with the quality of the sound since the JBL speakers and navigation are not a combined option with the XLE. The speakers surpassed my expectation by far. There are no buttons to change the radio; everything is touch screen which can pose as a problem while driving. Gas mileage is never as advertised but nevertheless very efficient. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the latest corolla generation back in October 2008. The new corolla is much, much roomier than before. There's plenty of power and yet this car still averaged about 27 mpg in the city and about 38 mpg on the freeway. Kinks usually need to be worked on with the first year of most new car designs. Our car certainly had a few problems... The radio's volume control would get stuck sometimes. The radio display works most of the time. The interior trunk release mechanism worked even less of the time. Fortunately, these three items are covered under warranty for the new owner. We sold this car not long ago in order to get the new prius for even better mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. I drive 30,000 or so miles a year, and this car seems ready and eager to handle the task. I went for the impossible to find 'S' with a manual trans, glad I did. Get into 5th gear on the highway, and although the tach shows 3000+ RPM's, its returning 36, 37 m.p.h. Amazing. Good pep, even with the A/C on -- which works great. My family of four took it on a week's vacation, no problem. The trunk's huge for a car this size. I have had no issues with this car wandering on the highways, and its been on the highway a lot already. I traded in a 3/4 ton truck (didn't need it) for this, and of course I miss the stuff my truck could do, but this is so much more practical for my life. </TEXT>

Personally, I like the way the steering feels, and I like the position of the clock (and other trip information). I drive 250 miles a day (yeah, I'm nuts), and do mostly high speed Interstate driving. This thing keeps up with no problems, and the fuel economy is great. Smart move on my part.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Clean, new look on the outside, and the smooth, VERY quiet ride - little road noise. Gas mileage </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2005 Kia Optima V6 for the all new Corolla. Best decision I ever made. The Corolla S looks very sporty in and out. Fit and finish is perfect unlike the Optima. And Toyota quality/reliability speaks for itself. This car feels just as roomy and is way more comfortable than the Optima. This car is very fun to drive. I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a quality built sporty small sedan with great gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is small, but does not feel cramped, at least in the front seat. The back seats are a bit cramped. It would be hard to get 4 full sized adults in the car without some one ending up with a knee in their back. The driver seat is ok, but seriously lacks lumbar support. Finding a place for your elbows while you drive is also difficult. Most of the controls are laid out in a logical manner, and are easy to find. However, the temp gauge, is nearly hidden in the lower right hand corner of the dash display. In an economy car, you expect a plastic dash, but feel of the plastics used in the Corolla are very harsh. The turn signal stalks feel very cheap.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage! So far, I have put 1400 miles on the car and averaged 38 on the highway. If the 1.8 liter engine and 4 speed transmission sustain Toyota's reputation for reliability, then this car should be on the road for a very long time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Getting 41 mpg+ on just 2nd tank of gas which makes everything else non-significant. Runs very quiet. Automatic lights and door locks nice features. Missing features: need clock in radio. Have to reach for door arm rests; uncomfortable. Seats aren't comfortable for long trips - lumbar area. Std. fabric quality is poor,will snag and show dirt quickly; already missing leather seats. Trunk latch in dumb place on floor, along with gas cap release, which will surely catch snow and dirt. Extra half inch of head room would have been nice as well as adjustable foot pedals. Since it only cost 20 bucks to fill it up after driving all day, I will learn to like everything else about the car.</TEXT>

It has great room, awesome fuel economy and overall is very well refined. The 1.8l engine couldn't be called fast but it's peppy enough and acceleration is good. Coming from BMWs and a Lexus it's a little noisier on the highway but other than that it has very few downsides.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had the car for 6 days and 340 miles. Car ride and handling is excellent at all speeds. Road and wind noise is not bad and acceptable. Bought the "S" model with the "SX" sport option. Great looks! Gas mileage 28 mpg combined city and highway. Hope it improves to 32-34 avg. Only on 2nd tank of gas and has away to go to be broken in. Very comfortable seats, roomy cabin frt and rear compared to the competition in its class. Reason questioning reliability, is the "trunk latch" failed. Used 10 times. Had to rope down trunk lid via the rear seat when laid down. Brought to dealer for repair. Latch on order. Hope this is not a sign of what's to come? Toyota reliability? Hoping it's just a fluke.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research before getting this car. I traded a 98 Audi A6, and was skeptical to get into an economy car. I had looked at the 2008s last year and wasn't impressed; they look like peppy college cars. The redesigned S looks sporty and fun without the sports car problems. Another big selling point for me was the 6 standard airbags and ABS. In Colorado weather those things are a must-have. And most important, I nearly fell over when I saw the MPG I was getting! 37 combining city and highway driving! My Audi maxed at 22! Guess that's the trade from a V6 to a 4 cylinder, but the pros for this car definitely outweigh the cons.</TEXT>

It drives very smooth at speeds of 70+. I don't know why "car experts" bash the driving experience. It does everything I want it to. You just have to remember it's not a race car, but it's great on the highway. Everything on the inside is within reach and easy to operate. I gotta tell you, when I drive it, I forget it's a Corolla, it really feels like much more. Great job Toyota!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The electric power steering produce vague steering feels, it is pretty comfortable and easy to drive at lower speed. On the highway it gets tossed around easily, very odd. Cruise control isn't included in the pricey XLE base price and it still uses plastic hubcaps whereas most of competitors use alloy wheels in their upper versions. Alarm system is activated at dealer for only $600.00! Brakes clank when it?s released at lower speed. Normal road vibration starting around 20 miles per hour creates dash noise and it squeeks, which get hided for wind noise around 55 miles per hour. At this point my only hope is the reliability and reputation of previous version remains on this 2009 model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2007 Toyota Corolla CE bought as a second commuter car for business. After driving it for about 11 months, I got tired of it small size and basic features. I traded it in for a 2009 Corolla S, 5 Speed 1.8 L. This car is much bigger inside, heavier and feels more substantial and less cheap. It is said that the first two years of a model are the best for build quality and then the manufacturer cuts corners to make more money. I noticed this in the reviews of the previous 2003 to 2008 editions of the Corolla. The steering could be a bit heavier. The car is very quiet, enhancing the audio system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling and driving experience are more positive than some of the reviews I have read. It feels more like my 1996 VW Golf. The sound system sounds great, and acceleration is a bit better than in the 2007, best if you turn off the stability and traction control. The brakes are better, too.</FAVORITE>

I love the Corolla because of its reliability, look, gas mileage and it just seems to have a little more pep than my 2007 did. I agree with the other reviews in that you've got to have both hands on the steering wheel at times to control the vehicle but I had the same issue with my 2007. I also agree that the temperature, clock etc. is horrible and would love to see Toyota update the stereo so that it displays the song and station call letters like the two GM rentals that I had.

<TEXT>One of my friends recently backed out into my rear bumper of my corolla, and it wasn't a very light impact, but my whole bumper came off, while his car doesn't even have a scratch. My sister has a '06 corolla, people have hit her car so many times in so many places, but nothing as drastic as a whole part falling off has happened to her. It is very disappointing that such a small accident could do such damage, makes me wonder what would happen if I got hit on a street where people are actually driving 30 mph, instead of 2?

<TEXT>After reading reviews on many websites I found that Civic is better than Corolla S, but when you test drive both you will find more room, driving comfort and other features in corolla than civic. I drive it daily 100 miles on freeways, at first steering feels loose but when you get used to it you will enjoy its easy handling. No need to say much about corolla reliability and MPG. I don't personally know any person who has problem with corolla on these. I have drove V8 SUV which also feels loose on the Interstates at more than >85MPH. With 132hp corolla and 140hp civic not gonna make much difference on power. Overall it's great looking car, great MPG, reliable and ya people confuse it for Camry.</TEXT>

I owned 1997 Corolla and it did not give me any problem. With the new one, I average about 27-30 mpg per tank (80% city & 20% hwy). I have standard stereo and the sound quality is very decent. Overall, I'm very happy with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Corolla for one year now and have driven it approx. 7,000 miles. I enjoy the car overall but there are some things that really annoy me about it. The panels for the side curtain airbags rattle and it annoys the bejesus out of me. It comes and goes. I have also recently noticed some more rattling noise (again, comes and goes) from the back area of the car. The gas mileage I get driving around the city isn't as good as advertised. It appears to be more like 25 for city driving and 30-33 on the highway. This was my first economy car. Being 6'3, I fit pretty comfortable in this vehicle. The engine is very quiet and has some quickness for being a 4 banger. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased new in April. Just took 450 mile trip. My Corolla owns up to numerous positive comments. Recent trip confirms Corolla's strong economy statistics. I averaged 37.6 MPG. That reading was only 1.4 MPG higher than my personal calculations - not a problem. Satisfied with ride. Noticed only minor drifting because of electric Power Steering. Quiet ride. Still making adjustment to having a compact car after always having mid-size (Taurus type) cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Plain and simple, the new Corolla is a well-built, great looking, comfortable- riding, highly fuel efficient car. My combined city/highway mileage is 36.4. I'm a little puzzled by the occasional complains about steering and interior materials quality. My car steers just fine, and I feel like I'm in a quality car inside. And the mileage is just about 8 mpg below a Prius. Again, great car. </TEXT>

We recently had a windy day (up tp 60 mph gusts) and I was driving on the highway doing 60+..NO PROBLEMS!!

<TEXT>I've had mine for 1,800 miles so far. I'm getting a combined avg. of 35+ mpg and over 40mpg on the highway already. I don't mind the clock like some others on here have complained about. I'm not a fan of electric steering boxes in any car, and it took me about a week to get used to this one, but I don't have any problems with it now. I'm 6'4", and although head and shoulder room are great I wouldn't mind an extra 1-2" or legroom up front. The dead pedal is nicely placed and angled well though. This isn't the most exciting car I've ever owned, but acceleration is adequate and fuel economy is great. This is a really good and practical commuter car.</TEXT>

I have two draw backs on this vehicle, first the clock is in a odd place, and the vehicle mph does not reflect the actual mph. I haven't noticed the steering problem that some owners are talking about, if I do I will be taking it in to the dealer for a fix. Overall this car is great. This is my forth corolla now,and I will recommend this vehicle to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Reliability I will not rate due to only having it a few days. This is my 3rd corolla and they have been flawless in reliability so I pray it remains the case. The car is very fun to drive, sporty and practical on economy. Has good power off the line and plenty of power in reserve when driving. Drives solid, powerful, and quiet like a European car. I hope Toyota recalls the rumored transmission issue they knowingly sell the car with. I have heard about it and pray it's not true, but I hope Toyota remains in good standing by honoring a fix to any known issue. Otherwise, this boy won't be buying anymore cars from them. It could be nothing but do your homework and keep abreast of news about this</TEXT>

<TEXT>Corolla s 2009, sporty look, comfortable, nice to drive, reliable, safe, great mileage, many features and largest car of its class. What else is missing - yes you may find it a little lower on the pick up but after all it's v4. We cannot compare it with v6/v8. But anyway driving on more than 85 you will not realize a noise or vibration but be careful on steering. Civic also is good car but is smaller than this one and corolla s looks more sporty than civic. It's just 2nd week of purchase and did put more than 1000 mile just love this car for its look, reliability and space. It's like a little Camry and is very similar to Lexus people say so.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I started out loving this car and wound up hating it in no time at all. Fuel economy, fair acceleration for a small engine, a 10-CD glovebox, and a really good stereo system do not make up for its shortcomings. Crosswinds of moderate speed can blow you out of your lane. The seat belt alarms are obnoxious. Every time my 50 pound dog moves, her seat belt alarm goes off. Oil change? You need to buy the hard-to-find paper cartridge that slips into the plastic cap with a metal clip that tears your hand to pieces every time. Roadside assistance for a flat tire? Good luck! All I got was the runaround! Holding its value? No way! I took quite a beating at trade-in time, 38K miles in 13 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven and owned almost all Toyota models, I can definitely say this compact car is just OK. The exterior looks great but the interior lacks the quality I've had with my previous Toyotas, cheap plastics. The small multi-information display is not helpful at all being placed awkwardly in the dashboard. The Electronic Steering is kind of a little stiff and the car sometime drifts in strong winds but got used to it after 1K miles. Runs smooth & very quiet, you just have to downshift if you want to outrun other cars in the Hway. Got a lot of compliments from other people but overall, I'm happy with my purchase considering the economy. Will keep this car for a long time and will enjoy it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have been reading a lot of posts about how bad the Corolla is. Well, one needs to remember that it is not a Camry. Have always had a camry (v6) and corolla...one for the highways, power and comfort and one for the daily fuel efficient commute. If one keeps the corolla long enough, they WILL realize how cheap the overall maintenance is in the long run. Yes, the quality has dipped some on the interior. Guess to keep the price the same and still have to improve the drive train, toyota had to cut corners, which is sad. My 2000 corolla had better interior than this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2009, Barcelona Red, Toyota Corolla LE with cruise control, in May 2008, and absolutely love it. I get over 40 mpg on the highway, and get about 28-30 mpg around town. It has a roomy interior, for a small car, and has nice pickup, for a 1.8 liter 4 cyl engine. I especially love the look of the headlight, and tail light displays, (which is very important to me), as well as the redesigned front grille look. The car steering/handling feels good, and the red color makes the car look bigger. The remote, tire low pressure indicator, adds a nice safety touch. All in all, this is a nice, good looking car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Less than 1000 miles since purchase. So far very happy. First compact ever purchased but was out of necessity (economy). Will report again in 6-9 months. Always had mid size vehicles so this is an adjustment that on first report seems to have been a good move. Anxious to take a long trip to get the real feel of the car and more accurate idea of true gas mileage. Like the reported reputation of Toyota vehicles. See ya in 6-9 months. Ratings given above are based on only having vehicle for one month. Liked the style compared to all considered. Really went to purchase the Corolla LE. However when I saw the S model I quickly made the mental financial adjustment to a much better looking vehicle. My wife wasn't too happy but reluctantly allowed me to go for it! </TEXT>

The car runs very smooth with no problems, and despite what many say, I have had no problems with the steering. The MPG is great. It's a fun little car to drive, great turn angle and super-easy to control. If you are into racing, you wont be beating v6 cars of course, but when you're up against another v4 consumer car, you will most likely come out as the winner thanks to the great engineering of this car.</TEXT>

And decided to try a Corolla (a guy I work with has a 2003 Corolla with 220,000 miles with no breakdowns), thats one reason I went with the Corolla , don't like the space ship look of the Civic si. The only complaint I have with the Corolla, is the highway noise above 60 mph. Anybody else, have this complaint? Also, my left front tire is wearing, on the outside edge. Might be alignment, rotated tires and diffrent front tire doing same thing. Would Toyota cover alignment since I have less than 11,000 mls.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought an ?09 Corolla. Immediately noticed wandering steering on the highway at greater than 60 mph. I heard that in some cases increasing tire pressure helps problem. Found out dealer had 40psi in tires when 30 is appropriate. I reduced to 30psi and it wanders more. Some people don?t have problems with it, but some cars are coming off the line with this problem. Have to have 2 hands on the wheel. If you take one hand off the wheel to adjust the radio (particularly if in winds greater than 15 mph) you may find yourself going out of your lane. I scheduled an appointment with the dealer who claimed to know nothing of the issue. It?s all over the internet and NTSB (25 complaints).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the worst car I've ever driven. Whatever small gains you get from the electric steering assist are nullified by any small gust of wind. You can't relax in a car when you're blowing all over the highway in the slightest wind. Furthermore, the seats are doughy and unsupportive. If you've ever had lower back problems in any car, this one will bring them right back. My Volkswagen had firm, supportive seats and I forgot what it was like to have a sore back after a trip - until now. Cheap backseats too - pull on a corner when they're "locked" and it will have enough give for you (or a criminal) to reach into the trunk. Awful creamsicle backlighting treatment on the dash too. </TEXT>

BUT last week the engine started to turn off in the middle of driving. It happened twice when I was going about 25 mph. I brought it to the dealer, they say nothing is wrong. It happened again at a red light, just turned off. I bought a new car to avoid repairs & wasted time, now I will be back at the dealership, no doubt to hear "nothing is wrong".

On the plus side, the new car is a little larger, has less road noise and seats are a lot more comfortable. On the negative side is the new steering system. The car does seem to drift when your driving on the highway.

<TEXT>This vehicle is providing on average above 37 mpg under normal driving conditions and 39+ on the highway currently. This is without the AC running. Two features I do not like are the lack of being able to manually control the headlights, and the vehicle came standard without intermittent windshield wiper capability. (Hard to believe on the wiper issue.) I also have some very strange noises coming from the left side of the engine compartment area that sounds as if something wants to come apart. So far, they have not been able to be identified. This makes the car feel unsecure at times. Overall though, the car is doing well at the nearly 10,000 mile mark.</TEXT>

The only reason I was drawn to the Corolla was more headroom (I'm 6' 4"), otherwise the Elantra is more car for less money with a better warranty. We have had one for 3 years and it has performed flawlessly. It came with more standard features, drives better both in the city and on the highway and gets slightly better gas mileage. The Corolla?s style is admittedly more stylish and sporty. Toyota should fire the person that placed the clock it makes me wonder about other engineering decisions, that was plain stupid.

It hurt my back so bad I traded it in after only 200 miles! Before you think that a short person would find this vehicle acceptable, please pay careful attention to the steering issue.

The seating position for the driver is comfortable. Gas mileage average for a fairly aggressive commuter driver is 32.5 mpg. What is disturbing about this car is the handling. This car does drift quite a bit in the wind. Body roll is also unsettling. The tires do hold the pavement, but the body roll makes fairly mild turns feel like I'm pushing the limit way too hard.

<TEXT>Bought the 2009 Corolla have been very disappointed so far. It seems to have a mind of its own and wanders around the road, if you glance away even for a moment you will wind up on the other side of the road. Have to keep both hands on steering wheel at all times. Constantly correcting steering to stay on road. And forget driving on a windy day. Glad we did not trade in our 2005 KIA or we would be driving our work truck. Bought Toyota because we all ways considered them a reliable cars. We see this as a safety issue and intend to pursue what ever means we have to. This is our first new car and will probably be our last as we will be on fixed income soon.

<TEXT>Owned a 1998 Audi A6 that had lots of bells and whistles, but also lots of quality and reliability issues. The Corolla is no Audi, but for 1/2 the cost it looks good, has many nice features and the gas mileage is the best attribute. It is not the fastest car, but it is not supposed to be. I got used to the steering feel within the first tank and do not have the issue of it tacking straight down the road. I like the looks of the 2009 Corolla, not just a vanilla small car. Drove several others, Elantra, Mazda3 and Civic, but liked the Corolla best for looks and features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've always been fond of Corollas and have driven them in the past. I was disappointed to find, after purchasing this one that these new models don't have the same great handling and steering that I've experienced in the older models. I find, especially when driving on the freeway that the car wanders and I don't feel likr I have a lot of control. I have to grip the steering wheel more intensely, which doesn't bode well for me since I had hoped to be able to use this car for road trips. Aside from steering, the car has met all of my other expectations. It's highly fuel efficient, has a great new look and size and the interior features are easy to manage. </TEXT>

Seat is still not working correctly. Sound system not great. No rear dome light, no glove box light or lock, no lights on visor mirrors. Cloth upholstery is a dirt magnet (unless you buy Toyota's protection package). Wipers don't work when there's frost on the window, until the car warms up. I bought this to replace my gas guzzling Honda mini van. Corolla = about 30 MPG with mixed freeway and street driving which I consider very good. Wish I'd stuck with Honda. Had looked at the Fit.

<TEXT>This is a great car for those of you looking for fuel economy. After my Honda Civic was totaled, I got the Corolla. I wanted something similar to the Civic, but more affordable. So far I don't have any complaints. I just took a 1000 mile trip to Oregon and I average about 32 MPG. I think that is a pretty dang good average. It was comfortable and easy to drive the whole way. I loved it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is ok compared to a Civic. I don't like that the car does not have an oil filter. Rattle noise on driver's side. The car does not shift properly until the engine is fully warmed up. Overall if you are looking for an economy car that's reliable and gets good gas mileage then this is the car for you. The car has no soul; not fun to drive by any means. Strictly a commuter car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety features, average fuel economy display (although, it's always higher than when I calculate by hand).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this car for my wife to run around town and back and forth to work. We traded in a 2000 Nissan Xterra and my wife is very happy with it so am I! We average 30 mpg city and 40-42 Hwy (safe range is about 400 miles on the Hwy) The 1.8 auto has plenty of get up and go and the transmission is fantastic. Ride and handling is good, electric steering requires correct driving form on the hwy (both hands on the wheel) around town its great for parking. We recently took it on a 1200 mile road trip loaded up with 2 adults and young child very comfortable although the door armrests are annoyingly low. We have always owned Toyota or Nissan, our old 93 Tercel had over 200,000 miles when sold.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Trip computer, excellent fuel mileage, seats on the "S" model are much better than base models. Virtually no wind or road noise at 70mph. We hope to get at least 10-15 years service out of this one for the money its hard to beat for a daily commuter occasional road trip vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This review is to update my previous review. Please take your 2009 Corolla for a highway test drive - I wish I had. Toyota Canada can not fix a vibration / shudder at highway speeds. I have had it in numerous times for repairs - even a team from L.A. could not resolve the problem . Apparently Japan is looking for a "fix". I am picking up my brand new GM product tomorrow - Toyota has lost a customer for life. I was pleased with the effort Toyota made in the repairs but totally disappointed in the end result - they simply left me hanging with a defective car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife traded in our 2008 Accord LX-P because of the sever wind/road noise. Only had the Accord less than eight months. Have had the Corolla for almost a month and she just loves it. It is quieter than the Accord and rides just as well or better. We put 17" wheels on it and it really looks sharp. The gas mileage is about 36 mpg on her daily commute of 85mi round trip, I like the comfortable seats and the power is more than enough to get you on the freeway. Can't say enough good things about the car. It was a great trade as far as we are concerned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the seats and driving position. The controls are easier to use than the Accord. Like the split glove box and the clock where it is located is no problem. I find the arm rest is fine also although that seems to be a problem for some.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Until recently I owned three BMWs and love the "It's about the ride", but do not love it is about the money and the maintenance, so my stable has changed and I am down to one old 318i. That said, the little S is fantastic, no heated seats, but automatic lights, JBL stereo with Bluetooth for the phone to be legal and best of all appears primarily only oil changes ever 5k until about 150k miles and that is so unlike a BMW. The reliability factor is worth the change. OK it doesn't drive like a BMW but again 35 plus miles per gallon and in this economy, it just made sense.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The JBL stereo with ability to plug in my iPod, utilize bluetooth devices, in particular my phone. The amount of information to get to know, additionally the fuel economy and lack of anything actually wrong with the car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> The Corolla features a timing chain rather than the usual belt, and has variable valve timing on both camshafts. The mileage is acceptable, although the speedometer reads about 2 mph fast at 35 mph. The fuel flow indicator shows 35.4 mpg after 1800 total miles, but the actual fuel consumption is 33.1 mpg. Adjusted for the previously mentioned speedometer error, that's about an actual 31 mpg. It has much more power than expected, and the full-time electric power steering is O.K. when I became accustomed to it. I'd buy it again, and the price is right compared with the available competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 1.8 engine and auto transmission are flawless, and the Continental tires are of high quality with a 540 tread-wear rating, unusual in this price range.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an update. This car is well built and gets good gas mileage. That is expected of Toyota. What I have found after driving the car for over 10,000 miles is that it is not very comfortable. The seats are kind of hard when driving more than 2 hours and the arm rests are too hard. Now for the reason for the update: This new car, the car that was to be my reliable commuter, is now parked for the winter. After a 3 hour trip two weeks ago. On the way there there was some heavy rain and wind. The car was nearly uncontrollable! The tires hydroplaned often. On the way back it snowed. The car was blown around and was difficult to drive. All season tires worthless. Be careful!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an update of my earlier review. Now that we have had our Corolla for several months I can be more accurate about the mpg. With careful driving we can get 30 mpg in the city and 40 mpg on the highway, using the AC will reduce this to about 28/38 mpg. This is fantastic for any car. Fast drivers will of course get less. We drive between 65 and 70 on the freeways. All in all the Corolla is a great value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After buying a car, it's a great feeling when you realize that the car is a lot better than what you had expected. I brought it as cheap car for my long daily commute and I am extremely happy with it. It's a little weak on power, but besides that, it is great. I am getting an "average" of 39 mpg. Great for single person commuting. I would recommend Camry if there will be more than two passenger. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to the dealership to get a Prius and ended up with a Corolla. Bad decision. If I was looking at fuel efficiency and fun to drive and style in a Toyota, I should've listened to my gut feeling and picked up the Yaris hatchback instead. It's far more pleasing to the eye. The Corolla only excels in build quality and fuel efficiency. These are major things for most people and most people seem to definitely go past the looks and driving dynamics of this awkward-looking refrigerator. The interior is not bad except it looks more like the Korean cars of yesteryear, the floaty ride is good if I am the passenger and 4-speed auto is to dated, so as the drum rear brakes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car last month after much contemplation. No matter how we put it this was the best choice for our money in this economy... & yes I used to drive a BMW 525i so it was not an easy decision for me. So far we are very happy with the performance of this car. Mileage is excellent, runs smooth, not so great on the luxury but the money we spent on BMW repairs, I rather go for an okay looking car that is cheaper to maintain and lasts much longer. The feel of steering is amazing like a luxury vehicle. Mileage is unbeatable. I am petite, my husband is 5'11" and we find the arm rest okay when it's slided front but could have been better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the wood trim, it goes great with the silver exterior. CD player and audio is great. No bump in the back for more passenger room. Great trunk size with foldable backseats. Daytime auto light, auto lock when reverse, keyless entry & trunk option. Door knobs & Exterior look. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the chance to own several new cars in the past 4 yrs ranging from a luxurious sport sedan to a crossover. The engine didn't start to feel "powerful" until about 300 miles. I test drove the LE trim w/ std wheels and it felt like it would tip over in turns, but the S I bought has wider 16" alloy wheels and feels much steadier; XRS w/ wider 17" should handle better yet. Steering is very soft & seems to have a mind of its own. Ride is nicely isolated, and road surface noises are muted well compared to my crossover. Interior looks much nicer than the Civic IMO, but several interior areas like the dash and center console are made of hard "cheap" feeling plastic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Daytime running lights w/ head/tail lights that turn on when it gets dark. Bright headlights & fog lights make nighttime driving easier. Mix of city/hwy driving has averaged 31 mpg. Large HVAC buttons. MP3 disc player w/ 6 speakers. Vehicle stability control, side curtain airbags, std. ABS.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a Corolla, but it looks sportier than previous model. Personally, I like to to look like a Corolla S which got a 1.8L powerplant - i.e. people will think that they can easily pass me. My XRS usually surprises people driving an Integra who think they can overtake me from stop (except they brutally cut into line, then I give up). It got tremendous torque for such a small car. However, it does come with a price - the gas mileage isn't great at all. Besides, the suspension is a bit too stiff. You can feel every manhole cover and every uneven spots on the road - a bit annoying. Aside from that, it is a nice little car - storage is great and interior feels spacious.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2.4L powerplant. Spacious interior. Look. Handling (despite the weird-feeling drive-by-wire steering wheel). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Corolla S is affordable, has great styling, an interior that doesn't rattle, an engine that will scoot- is quiet- and gets way over 30 mpg, and most importantly, is a "compact" car that has a respectable trunk. I am averaging 37 mpg so far with about 70% highway driving. The car will easily accelerate when you need to pass. The transmission is great, picks a gear and does not struggle up hills-- quick to comply with a downshift if you put your foot down. The trunk opening is HUGE, much larger than a Cobalt. Seats are comfy. AC blows cold. JBL stereo is incredible, I set ASL off, Bass +2 and Treble +4. Turn it to 45 and ROCK</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth engine, great MPG, excellent styling, JBL stereo is loud and full of bass, nice wheels, subdued orange/amber gauge lighting, 2 car chargers, 2 Glove boxes, huge trunk opening, cold AC, small cubbies next to center stack to hold your cell phone.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had an 08 and put 27000 on it, but the 09 is so much better. We just got back from a trip down to SC. and I averaged 39 mpg @ 65 to 70 mph. I am tall and had no complaints about comfort. I even like the electric steering now that I am used to it. The one thing I do not like about it is the special tool I need to remove the oil filter for doing my own oil changes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Corolla S is exactly what I was looking for. Great looks, nice interior and Toyota reliability. While some reviews on this car put is behind the competition, I think the real points are missed. Let's face it, people buy Toyota's for their reputation of being safe and reliable. This new Corolla is all that, plus it looks great and is very comfortable. It is my third new Toyota and I hope I remain as happy with this car as my previous Toyotas!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 99 Mazda Protege for a Corolla LE. I wanted a reliable car that would last about 10 years without a lot of problems. I test drove a Subaru Impreza and Honda Civic and just felt safer in the Corolla. The car has adequate "get up and go" and has almost no wind noise on the freeway. The seats are very comfortable, they are set higher up and give you a great view of the road while driving. The only distraction is the placement of the armrests - too low on the door. The car has a great stereo and the placement of the interior features are perfect and very easy to use. Overall this is a great car for the money and comes with Toyota's reputation for reliability. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this as a second car for my wife because she wanted a reliable vehicle and opted for the Corolla. Now I wish I would have convinced her to buy a Civic. I just deplore the electric steering. No feel whatsoever! Highway passing is a venture in itself. I found myself adjusting in the lane because of a dead spot in the wheel. Reminded me of the old Chev truck my father drove back in the sixties. Terrible! Another thing is the ride. I hate it. All this is good for is going to the grocery store. Good thing it's only a few blocks away.</TEXT>
